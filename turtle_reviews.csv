Your unpainted miniatures are very not bad. Your spell cards are great. Your board games are ""meh"". Your DM screens, however, are freaking terrible. I'm still waiting for a single screen that isn't polluted with pointless artwork where useful, reference-able tables should be. Once again, you've created a single use screen that is only useful when running the ""Storm King's Thunder"" adventure. Even despite the fact that it's geared to that adventure path, it's usefulness negligible, at best. I massive swath of the inner panel is wasted on artwork and a bloated overland map, which could have been easily reduced to a single panel in size. And the few table you have are nigh-useless themselves.

In short, stop making crap DM screens.",Another worthless Dungeon Master's screen from GaleForce9
Female,22,13.12,6,40,graduate,EN,Web,254,"Nice art, nice printing.  Why two panels are filled with a general Forgotten Realms map is beyond me.  Most of one of them is all blue ocean.  Such a waste.

I don't understand why they can't make these DM Screens more useful for these ""kinds of adventures"" rather than solely the specific adventure.  You're supposed to be able to transpose this adventure to other lands outside the Forgotten Realms.  So even just a list of new monsters or NPCs would at least be useful than the map.  Even more would just be stuff related to running the game but broad-use stuff related to giants.

Same thing with Curse of Strahd.  Why not make it useful for raven loft, undead or horror campaigns in general... instead a huge amount of screen space is solely mapping out Castle Ravenloft, which is only useful during a small fraction of the time even for the Curse of Strahd adventure, let alone various other Ravenloft adventuring.

They really kill the extended use of these screens by not thinking about their potential use, both for the adventure in question, as well as use in a broader sense.

The Rage of Demons screen is far more useful for broad under dark adventuring - covering a lot of rules for the various conditions you may suffer... and the map is only one panel.

This Storm Giants one is decent for a few tables it includes - but really misses the mark.  Maybe they should ask a few DMs what they would use?","pretty, but also pretty useless"

Female,32,15.58,72,724,PhD,EN,Web,1459,"My review will mirror others in that this kind of misses the mark and there are some lost opportunities to help DM's.  I wouldn't advise new DM's to use this by itself.  They should stick to the generic 5e DM screen and just copy/print the other useful information for SKT.
I do like that the information they did put in the screen was relevant to the game and makes accessible some of the frequently visited tables from the adventure book.  I also like the map from the perspective that it contains the page references to the cities and locations. This is pretty useful, especially during Ch 3 of the adventure.
However, there is a very Large amount of wasted space that could easily have been utilized instead of having the whole map take up 2 panels of the screen. The middle of the ocean could have contained info on the Giant hierarchy, the Giant Rune symbols, the Random encounters at Sea table from the DMG, trap tables, or any number of other usefully applicable information to the story.  I would have done away with the Sea portion of the map completely and used that space more efficiently.  In all actuality, the entire map could have been an extra insert, freeing up far more space and making this product far more appealing...or the Adventure book could have included it as a tear out.  There should have been better collaboration on this product.
On a different note, the printing on my copy of the screen was not sized correctly.  The Left and right creases are right over the edge of the words...especially on the Right side.  It is almost illegible when the screen is up and in it's general position at the gaming table.(See attached pic)

I can understand the idea and desire to produce tailored DM Screens for these adventure books, but I don't feel they've truly taken the time to get feedback on their ideas from enough sources before printing. It's coming across as licensed money grab instead of a Value Add product to the adventure line.",Another missed opportunity.  Not a value add to the product line.

Female,37,17.22,35,417,graduate,EN,Web,486,"Pretty good book with a variety of unique card sleights (palming, manipulating cards in the deck, etc.). These sleights are the 'real work', so it will take a little perseverance. Many of these utility sleights are ones that you ought to know if you want to be a card sleight-of-hand worker.
The instructions are generally clear, but sometimes a detail here and there gets a little confusing. There's a fair number of photos showing how to do many of the sleights.
Sometimes a sleight is a little more complicated than it needs to be. My recommendation is to follow the author's steps in slow-motion with a deck of cards in hand. After you are familiar with the overall effect, you can make adjustments based on what your comfortable with. There may also be other newer methods for learning these sleights if you want to invest in newer card sleight instruction (such as the Daryl Encyclopedia of Card Sleights videos, etc.).
Right now, I'm working on the side steal sleight. He gives a T. Nelson Downs version which has some merit, but it is much more complicated than necessary. The author's own version is a little more do-able. But even the author's method becomes a little too fidgety, so I've made minor modifications to make it work well for me. I start in slow-motion, counting through the substeps to keep pace while I do the move (1..2..3..4). Then I repeat it until I can bring it up to full speed.
If you want to learn sleights for cheap, try this book. You may have to pick and choose through the sleights, and there may be better methods to perform some of these sleights now, but it's not bad for under $10.",Good book
Male,22,17.22,66,579,PhD,EN,Web,830,"When I unexpectedly came across a picture of Buckley on the first page of the book, and after hearing the other reviews of how difficult and advanced the techniques in the book were, I couldn't believe my eyes. I was surprised to see the face of a handsome teenager, of which my previous impression was COMPLETELY the opposite to the one I held in my hands. And this guy was a professional card magician at the age of 18, and able to do tricks infront of hundreds of people on-stage in 1908!
I have a feeling that this guy's mystery and skill probably gained him significant success with girls his age. The mysterious effects of these difficult to execute sleights are priceless and dazzling beyond belief. If a 3 columns card trick can make girls believe in magic.. then Buckley's stuff probably knocked their socks off... literally! Believe me, this guy would be able to blow David Blaine out of the water and make him look like Bob Longe.
That being said and out of the way, the book itself is amazing. There are very clearcut photos of Buckley's hands and very impressive card tricks, or as he calls them in the fourth section, ""Card Experiments"". Best of all, this book isn't like most others where the authors seem to purposely be vague (S.W. Erdnase) and not give the best descriptions. Mr. Buckley gives you every detail and is your friend throughout the book, showing you exactly how everything is done without any confusion.

It is entirely possible that he/she will be ultimately disappointed (or at least frustrated) that their art won't resemble the professional examples provided considering the minimal directions given.

Four double-sided color pencils (for a total of eight different colors), a black marker (for bolding), speech balloon stencils,  and an eraser are provided.  The problem here is that it really becomes more practice in tracing than actually learning how to draw.  Each exercise is four steps: 1. a stick figure; 2. the pipes 3. details; and 4. ""detailed"" details.  There aren't any transitional instructions on how to actually get from Step 1 to the final image; it is just a visual demonstration.  This book is best for those amateurs with some basic art class experience in terms of knowing how to draw details once they've have made the circles and connecting lines.

This book is the perfect skill level for someone like me.  I mostly can copy things right now, but if I draw something from memory, my lack of skill is apparent. That was my motivation behind buying this book.  I needed to build on my skills and this book looked like the perfect thing to help with that.

The book starts out with having you trace some pictures just to get your hand and eye used to drawing different lines.  I have to say that this may have been one of the most interesting pieces of advice that I have learned from this book so far.  I would have never even considered tracing something in the past, but now I want to go buy some tracing paper and try a little more tracing.

As you move through the lessons they become more difficult.  After tracing, you work on stick figure frames for the characters, next you practice ""piping"" which is where you draw guides for the outside lines, and then finally you move on to the detailing that really makes your drawings come alive.

The book is set up so that you can draw in the book itself.  This is a great idea as well, but this is also where I ran into my issues with the book.

1. It's too small.

At 8.5 x 8.6 inches the book isn't even as big as a standard piece of paper.  It's tough to practice drawing details when you don't have much room to fit those details into.

2. The book doesn't lay flat

The book has a traditional binding so the pages have and arch to them when you try to lay it out flat to draw in it.  You need to press down on the pages to flatten them and even then there is still a little curve to them.  It makes it tough to draw straight lines at times and since I, and the target audience of this book, aren't that great of artists at this point, it really makes it frustrating to do some of the lessons.

If this book had spiral binding, like a notebook, and was larger I would give it 5 stars in a heartbeat.  As it stand now, it's 4 stars for me.  I am still glad I bought it because I really feel like it gave me some good things to practice.",Good for beginners

Make sure you have comfortable scissors - cutting the yarn down the middle when making the pom pom definitely required some elbow grease. Tuck the eyes as deep as possible into the fur, or else the puppy will look bugged eye. Also, I scanned the paper punch-outs of accessories to print for future use so I won't ""run out.""

Female,29,49.2,50,1503,postgraduate,EN,Web,3436,"As an adult crafter who likes simple projects to relieve stress, I enjoyed this product very much, even though there are a few minor flaws. I'll list some pros, cons, and suggestions below.

Pros:
The book provides detailed directions for seven different dog breeds in addition to abbreviated suggestions for how to create an unlimited number of breeds on your own.
Book directions are clear and detailed with large, accurate pictures.
The pompom maker is sturdy and easy to use. I had no problem creating pompoms easily my first try.
The kit comes with enough basic supplies to make four adorable puppies, provided you take yarn measurements into account
I was very satisfied with how cute my puppies turned out!

Cons:
The basic school glue provided was not strong enough to hold the heads to the bodies or the felt ears to the heads.
The punch-out dog carriers were too small for all of my pups.
The kit is probably a bit too challenging for most eight-year-olds. I'd recommend it for ages ten and up.
While there is enough yarn provided to make four dogs, there is not enough to make any four you want. Some dogs require too much yarn if you want to create four dogs total.
The measuring tape on the back of the book measures in inches and centimeters, while the book directions are in yards.

Suggestions:
Use a hot glue gun to hold the dog together. I used superglue, but my puppies are a little fragile.
Take yarn measurements into account when choosing pups or just buy more yarn at a craft store.
If you wrap the yarn around the height of the book, you'll have half a yard of yarn. Use this cheat mentioned in the book instead of the confusing ruler.
When the book says to cut the yarn short, be sure to cut it quite short or your pup might look a little messy and shaggy.

Overall I really liked this kit and would definitely recommend it.",Had so much fun with it!

There is not enough yarn to do any animal that's one color only. That's a mistake on the part of the makers since the multi-colored pets are a little harder to make. The Pomeranian pup had black yarn at the back of her head in the pic I attached.

I think this will continue to be fun for my girls. I might try a hot glue gun for the next pup since the included glue needs a ton to keep things stable & it still isn't as much as I'd like.",Great craft overall.

I feel a mom should have edited the instructions to find the weak areas that would clearly be cause for pause for little ones trying this on their own.
One weird part too is when you finally start to cut the yarn the instructions indicate something like ""you might find the yarn falls to the middle when you are cutting...don't worry! it won't fall out"" when in fact OH HECK YEAH its gonna fall out...unless you position your other hand to hold the middle of the donut appliance firmly to hold the shreds in place.

Adult crafters will likely find this unchallenging, and younger kids, like my 5 year-old will, likely need some help, at least initially, but for anybody in between - if this looks like fun for you, it very probably will be.",The crafters in the house love this
Female,42,63.96,20,925,PhD,EN,Web,4619,"My daughter wanted this so badly. So she forked over her allowance and bought it. We've used Klutz books for ages and usually have great success. This one was a bit of a dud. It was really difficult to make the pompoms using the enclosed pompom maker. They kept falling apart and once you've cut the yarn, there isn't any way to fix it except to buy more. I've done crafts all my life but I just couldn't get how they wanted the pompom maker to work. My daughter failed and so did I. When it became unfruitful, she gave up. Since there are others who have made it work, I can only assume we were not doing something right. But if this is for kids, it should be fairly easy.

Unfortunately, it has not been touched since the first few tries.","So Excited to Try, Difficult to Execute"

I just went to the craft store to buy more yarn because the kit doesn't come with much (as expected).  Lion Brand Hometown USA appears to be the exact type of yarn used in the kit.  I also ended up using my 85mm Clover Pom Pom maker instead of the one that came with the kit.  The one that comes with the kit doesn't snap together very well and the yarn falls out after it's been cut where as with the Clover Pom Pom maker, the yarn doesn't fall out after it's been cut and the pom pom stays together until after it's been tied.",Good but pom pom maker sucks

I did think ahead and by more yarn which was a good thing because it does only come with a small starter collection of yarn. ( which I expect  with this type of book...I figure I am paying for the guide and any materials it comes with is a bonus!)

My only suggestion would be to buy a lot of extra super glue because the one that comes with it doesn't hold and you'll probably need extra yarn. One of my kits was missing eyes, noses and tongues but after a call to the manufacturer they sent me two entire replacements so I can't complain about that.",Great craft activity
Male,36,63.96,1,44,postgraduate,EN,Web,6287,"This kit is AWESOME! My 5-year old daughter and I made the chihuahua dog first, and it came out looking exactly like the picture. Although I love crafts I'm not that great at them, so I was delighted with this result. This is the first project I have ever done where the finished product looked as good as the picture - and on the first try!

The book gives really straight-forward, easy-to-follow instructions. They show you how to make dogs that look like the real breed! We have made 6 dogs now, from the easiest to the most complicated in the book, and they're all great.

My daughter wraps the pom pom and cuts the pom pom. I do the tying. She cuts out the ear shapes, and decides which decorations to use. For a 5-year old, she can be quite involved, but she definitely needs my help. It's a really fun project to do together.

One thing: the glue in the kit is actually pretty good, but you'll still have to hold pieces on and wait for things to dry. We have a little hot glue gun, and this has made the process easier and probably helps keep the dogs holding together better. My daughter is playing with the ones we made and sleeping with them and they hold up like regular stuffed animals!

We made 4 dogs with the kit supplies, then promptly went to the craft store to buy more supplies to make more pups! We bought a bunch of different thick yarn types and they all worked well and gave different effects! Once you get the hang of it you can get creative too. You could easily make cats, rabbits, a turkey - whatever you want that you can imagine doing with pom pom shapes.

Pros:
Great, easy directions
Nice supplies in the kit
Variety - you can make so many types of dogs!
Fun project to do with your kids
The finished product is super cute and kids will love them like real stuffed animals
Kids could make these as gifts for their friends, or even ornaments for relatives
Lots of room for creativity
You can keep making dogs forever by buying supplies at the craft store
Price - you get to make 4 dogs, which equals out to less than what you'd pay if you bought a similar pre-made dog at the store
Amazon price- I bought this in a store and paid 20 bucks so the price here is great
This kit would make an awesome present for any young girl!

Cons:
The glue: this kit is a lot more fun if you invest in a hot glue gun
More money :) if you love this kit as much as we do, you'll end up spending a lot more in the craft store to keep going with it!

I hope you have as much fun with this project as we have!",Easy! Finished product as cute as the cover!

The Easter Story Egg does not disappoint!  There is no doubt it will be a fun way to help us keep Jesus at the heart of our Easter celebrations, as well.  We just got our nesting eggs and book a few days ago and our kids (ages 5, 3, and even the 1 year old) couldn't have been more excited!

They seem to be holding up well to their semi-rough handling, as they are solid wood, though I have tried to the limit the play so they're still new and exciting to use at Easter!
As with the Star from Afar, the art is simple, but beautiful, and clearly illustrates the message for my pre-readers.  The 7 mini-stories, matching each of the nesting eggs and intended to be read one a day from Palm Sunday through Easter, are told through original poetry in a quality hard cover book.  I appreciate that there is a Bible verse with each days story, as I can use that verse as a place to start in our daily Bible reading or choose one as a memory verse for my kids during the Easter week.

I felt each section was too long to read. Also sometimes with rhyming stories the sentence construction is awkward for kids to understand since it is worded to allow for phrases to rhyme.  I could see that in a family setting one could read it and stop to talk about it. I'm very experienced as a story teller so I used each part of the egg to tell the story myself with children supplying facts from their own knowledge. I also made a strip of paper for each child with 8 eggs each smaller than the first and labeled with the days of the week and one word for each day. Sunday- Praise God and children put a palm leaf sticker on the egg, Monday- Respect God, children used a glue stick to add a small picture of the temple I had printed form clip art, Tuesday Love like Jesus did, a heart sticker, Wednesday- offer your best, rubbed a spice scent lip balm on it, Thursday- Remember Jesus added a small clip art picture of the last supper, Friday- Forgiven a cross sticker and for Saturday and Sunday the phrase Jesus rose from the dead.

Although the eggs could be played with now and I could explain each one at her level, the story is beyond her comprehension.

Also, as described on the box and in an email from the company, the wooden eggs were new, and needed a few days to dry out and become accustomed to the lower humidity level in our home. I carefully opened each egg, per instructions, and set them out.  At the time, I wondered if I should put the eggs back together to dry, or leave them apart.  When I tried to put the eggs back together a few days later, one egg just wouldn't fit together.  I emailed the company right away, and two days later, received a replacement.  I notice the updated instructions now say to ""Please take the eggs out of the nesting position and re-close them separately to dry.""",Beautiful set! I originally ordered this with my almost ...

I did this and when I went to put them back together, all but one of the eggs were so warped that they would no longer close. Now the eggs don't stack together.

The cross Jesus was crucified on was not pretty, like the egg painting.  I find the book itself to be too wordy.  I used it with three groups of preschoolers and it was hard to keep their attention.  They could only look a the egg so long and the words in the book are too long for the looking at the pictures.  I don't regret purchasing it.

Female,33,32.8,42,904,graduate,EN,Web,3885,"I bought this for my 3 year old (and some of the pieces would be too small for any child under that age), and she loves it...but entertainingly, so did I and quite a few people at work (all of us 30+), as we had no self control and had to open it up and play with it for a little bit before I gave it to her (uh, to ""test"" it out).  It is a lot of fun to play with either on your own or with someone else - trying to architect the house together.  This one and the cupcake/bakery set are really both adorable - and my daughter has sustained an interest in both for a long time.  We've had the bakery one for over a year, and although we've lost many of the magnets, she returns to it all the time.  (I just bought this house one recently, but I assume it will be a similar fascination).  One thing I will say - having had the cupcake one for a while - the box did eventually dent, and with both of the sets, I've found it a little frustrating trying to get the cards out of the box (as they stick in there really well)... my daughter is actually better at removing them than I am (!!!), and I'll note the company who made it was very thoughtful in scalloping the bottom to make it easier.  The magnets are pretty strong.  I really do recommend this - especially to bring to restaurants or on a plane (or maybe for an older kid, the car - but I know we would lose the pieces if I gave it to my 3 year old while driving!).

This would be a great travel toy because you can't play with it unless it's in the box. Everything sticks in there. The one gripe I have is that it looks like there are 4 different cards to play with, but there are only 2 cards front and back, and they all fit inside the box, so you can only really look at one at a time, 2 cards max if you spread it out on another magnetic surface like a fridge.

The game itself is fun and different from other finance games. On the older version that I played, the game tiles were plastic and fit into a grid to prevent slippage. On the new version, the game tiles are made of a cardstock and there is no grid. This is an annoying difference only when you are trying to play a game near animals or small children. Otherwise it's fine. This version of the game is available at a lesser cost than any of the originals on Ebay, so if you want it, snap it up while it's available!","Not as durable as the original, but readily available once again!"

The board is flat and the tiles are a very light cardboard, so bumping the board is a problem.  This is a step down from previous editions with indented plastic boards and hard plastic tiles that plugged into them.  However, the player trays for holding the tiles is a nice touch and the new stock certificates have both a nice look and feel.  The graphics are nice and the box is small and light, which is good for portability.  Given the relatively low price, I think it is a decent value for your money, particularly if you don't already own a copy of this excellent game.

I have even been watching ebay for quite some time to find a 1999 version but if you can find one it will frequently go for over $100 it is that good.

However, this new version is total crap.  They changed the look and feel of the game.  I guess Avalon Hill doesn't listen to their customers or understand the value of the game they once produced.",Bring back the 1999 Version!!!!
Male,32,71.34,75,3455,diploma,EN,Web,7042,"The other reviews are correct, there are other versions of this great game that will hold up better and are better looking. However, I would want to make sure that anyone who doesn't already own this great game is aware that the game itself is a lot of fun and there are many variations/rules variants that can also keep it fresh for long time players. If you haven't tried partnership Acquire, give it a try, it's a whole different game.

For those not familiar with the game, there are tiles that are placed on the game board. When two or more are joined, they form a hotel chain. Only 6 hotel chains can exist on the board at a time, so certain tiles can become unplayable for a period of time. When a tile is played that connects two hotels, they are merged with the longer chain taking over the smaller. If they are the same size, the person playing the merging tile determines which chain takes over.

The subtleties of the game make it one of the true gems of boardgames. Sid Sackson developed the original version about 50 years ago and hundreds, if not thousands, of games have been developed since that in same ways have employed some of the mechanics and strategic elements of this game. Each player has unique information about the future growth of the hotels and the upcoming mergers. They can each take advantage of this but of course, other players can observe what they do and infer what information they have...

If you haven't played this game, you should definitely try it out. You may later find yourself searching on ebay for one of the earlier versions, but this will certainly be a great addition to your games closet if you don't already have it!","Game is great, better versions exist if you can find them"

Female,32,72.16,86,4007,postgraduate,EN,Web,6431,"Nothing super fancy about this game but it's still fairly solid. We are big gamers and have heard of this game for while and the ratings are pretty high for it so we thought we'd try it out.

The board itself is pretty boring and I thought I would like it or it would be too math oriented because of the buying and selling of stock but that's not the case! It is actually really easy in that regard. And it's surprisingly satisfying matching up your square to the letter/number spot on the board. Not very complicated game play but still played well.

Overall, a decent game. I would say it's not a regular in our game play but we do bust it out on nights when we don't want such an intense game or when we may have gaming newbies for its simple play.

My only concern is that you need to not loose a single piece otherwise your game play will be messed up so if you aren't good at keeping all your pieces this game may quickly get passed over because of lost pieces.","A little under impressed, but still an okay game."

Sound dry? Well, it is a little dry. But it does tell a pretty good story. It is fun to see a little startup company grow into a giant that gobbles up its rivals. There is also a neat mechanic at work where the game doesn't end until a player formally announces that the end conditions have been met, by either announcing that four companies are a set size of tiles, or one company has become too big.

I understand the rating is lower because previous versions of this had a higher quality of components. To me the component quality is alright for the $30 price tag, and overlooked in these complaints is the quality of the stock cards which are of good print. I honestly would not pay for a more expensive version of this game because while I enjoy playing it as a basic game of economics, there are a few problems. The tile draws can be quite random, there is no player elimination but a bad bet early on can eliminate a player from making meaningful plays due to him/her having his money tied up in a company that doesn't get bought out.

Overall, it's a pretty simple yet engaging little game that worth a buy at its $30 price tag. If you're interested in a startup sim with a stock element, then you really cannot go belly up with this purchase.",Do you want to acquire Acquire?

Female,45,98.4,16,1156,graduate,EN,Web,4065,"This is a great alternative to Monopoly, in which your success is largely based on luck, in the form of dice rolls or drawing Chance/Community Chest cards. Here, your success is partially based on the luck of the tiles you draw, but after that, strategy takes over. Do you invest in other players' hotels, or only your own? Do you choose to merge with another hotel, or just grow on your own? Do you risk building a hotel so large that no one can buy you out? Because that's how you make money!

I love this game, but my husband won't play it anymore, and I see his point. All 3 times we've played it, he's gotten stuck in the same trap. He formed hotels and bought stock in the early game, until he ran out of starter cash. After that, he didn't draw the right tiles to connect his hotels with anyone else's. So, his hotels never merged, and he never made any more money. Which means he couldn't buy stock in anyone else's hotels. He essentially sat there watching everyone else play, without cash, waiting for the lucky connecting tiles that never came. He acknowledges he probably just had terrible luck, and that scenario probably wouldn't happen again. I wish there were a mid-game rescue rule to help bail out players who find themselves in this position.

I still love this game! I know lots of reviewers are attached to the old-style gameboard in which the tiles slotted in place. I've never played the old style, but the cardboard tiles and board in this edition work just fine. They aren't finely crafted as Scrabble wooden tiles, but they get the job done. I will agree, the cardboard trays in which you keep your tiles are pretty flimsy. Just grab the wooden trays out of your Scrabble box, and all will be well.","A fun alternative to Monopoly, but some players can feel left out"

Background: Remake of the game from the 1960's by 3M of the same name. The object of the game is to profit by connecting two or more squares to form a hotel. If two (or more) hotels end up touching, they merge, with the larger hotel (the one with the most squares) acquiring the smaller one. Money is made by buying shares in hotels and having them grow. Bonuses are paid out to the majority and minority shareholders, and the process is repeated until the squares are all used, or no legal moves are left.

Great strategy game with a enough chance built in to frustrate the best-laid plans. (Invest in large hotels and be cash-poor, or invest in small hotels and hope for a pay-day--lots of ways to play).

Don't let words like finance, shareholders, stock, or merger scare you away. The game is so easy, my six year-old daughter is able to play (with help)--and do well! A great, original game. My friends (who aren't finance majors) love it.

Only four stars due to cardboard construction, and smooth board (which allows pieces to ""meander""--your OCD friends may go nuts). The older versions of this game had a raised grid to keep pieces in place.","Excellent, simple, original game"

It's very watered down for my usual tastes.  Gameplay consists of playing tiles on a board to start, expand, or merge hotel chains.  Then you buy stocks, trying to predict which ones will grow so you can buy as low as possible and sell them for huge profits by the end of the game.  The player with the most money at the end wins.

I think this game is certainly better with more people.  It can accommodate up to 6 and that may be too many (I've never played with that number) but with 3 or fewer it is too easy to run away with the game.  More players offers more competition and gaps between your turns and dilutes the available stock.  With three you can see what tiles you have available and buy up huge amounts of stock early before other players have time to react and attempt to thwart your plan or prevent you from a big pay-out.

I've enjoyed Power Grid and have intended on playing a deeper economic game for some time but this certainly isn't it.  This is much more shallow an experience although it does play reasonably quickly and may fill a shorter time slot if players are looking for a quick buy and sell stock game.",Boring

Now some people would complain that this game involves a lot of luck.  It can indeed trip you up.  Because you might get stuck and invested in a hotel chain that never goes down and you are broke for most of the game.  That does happen every now and then.  And it sucks when it does.  But don't let that turn you off to the game.  There is a lot of serious strategy going on here.  Since a person lays a tile down each turn, you need to buy stock in each hotel according to how soon you think it will go down.
So if I love the game so much how come I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars?  Because this version of it is hands down weaker than the old version.

Female,40,27.88,17,338,diploma,EN,Web,3645,"I don't know if Ive ever taken more delight realizing how the tiles available to me assured my victory.  I couldn't contain my maniacal laughter.  You see, I was the majority shareholder of the corporation that was poised to gobble up all the little people- all the corporations that the other players had invested their hopes of success and they were about to be heart-broken.  Notice though, the key to victory was that tiles were available to me.  I recently played again against a very capable friend and others- who were probably also capable- but the randomly drawn tiles he needed went to someone else who may have hoarded them in spite (I know I did some of that) and his power plays that would have propelled his ambitions were always pre-empted and spoiled.

While usually opposed to games that involve heavy elements of luck, I am apparently making an exception for this game perhaps for so shallow a reason as Ive been so often on the better side of luck.  That said, this game does involve a lot of card counting and positioning, even baiting other players, so frustration can be keen when your carefully laid plans flop.  It leads to a terribly tense game that will keep you from getting to sleep as your mind keeps spinning around what actions brought fruit and which did not.  This is how it works:

Game Play
Youve got a board with plain-Jane grid of numbers and letters, and a stack of tiles for each square.  You randomly draw tiles and can place one each turn and buy up to 3 shares.  If- when you place a tile- you connect previously unconnected tiles you get to start a new corporation- and you get a share- for free!  You still get to buy three more.  Sometimes when you place a tile, you will connect two separate corporations, this triggers a merger where the smaller of the two- or if its a tie, the person to placed the merging tile gets to choose which corporation is bought out.  Now the person who holds the most shares gets a payout, and the person who holds the second largest gets a smaller payout.  Now you can do one of three things:
  Trade your shares two for one into the new parent corporation
  Sell your shares
  Keep your shares in hopes that the corporation will be resurrected on the board later
Shares get more expensive as corporations get larger and corporations can get large enough that they become safe and cannot be merged.

I hate to tell you what to do but
While you can buy shares from any and all open corporations on the board, you would profit from focusing your effort on only three or four.  Because it is difficult to keep track- at least for me- of how many of each your opponents have purchased.  Its especially relieving when the other players are spending their money on shares of corporations you don't care about.

While some hotel chains are higher-rent than others, don't think that you can put all your eggs in one basket.  Even if you are at one time the majority stock holder in the ritziest corporation, you will quickly be bankrupt and others will be able to outspend and pass you.

Ignore participating in small corporations at your peril.  Players who get payouts get money.  Bankrupt is not a place you want to be in for very long in this game.

Theme
Im especially pleased- as someone who cant afford to become even a minority share holder in a real corporation- to get sucked into the world where individual jobs don't exist to me (they are conveniently outside the scope of this game) when I consider merging companies because I need that gross severance for selling out so that I can uh create more jobs with a new corporation, yeah thats it.  Its not about me getting the most money at the end at all.  This teaches nothing about the harsh realities of capitalism, and gives me no insight whatsoever into the minds of corporate giants.  But I have to admit that I love it all the same.

Balance
There are no catch up mechanisms in place in this game, so someone can run away with it, but its a game where you can always claw for second place.  That is, you're personal economy will never be destroyed beyond repair leaving you sitting watching everyone else at the table rejoice in spoils.  I find a lot of satisfaction being able to claw for second place myself.  This is because I, like you have the ability to synthesis happiness.

Interaction
Interaction is high in this game.  Nothing inspires audible grumbling like someone overtaking your position as majority share holder.  And the table is abuzz when mergers happen.

Learning Curve
Very low, The manual is very small.  The vast majority of the rules were explained above and they have a handy little lookup sheet which tells the share prices and payouts for each corporation and for what size.

Downtime
While you do have to wait your turn while others take theirs, and you can annoy people by not paying attention to what others do and when its your turn suddenly the board has changed- youll likely lose because you spent too much money buying shares when no one was competing with you and youll have no one to blame but yourself.  This never happened to me mind you, but I have a friend that  Any downtime you take during this game will be at your expense.

Whats not to Like?
The new edition that I bought is made a little cheaply.  The trays that hold the drawn tiles are cardboard that you put together- well I put mine together, not you.  Its not beautiful to look at, but whats gorgeous about corporate greed?  Dare I say the plainness is part of the theme?  That said, the share cards are easy on the eyes.

Collateral Endorsements
It gets requested by my gaming groups and my wife, who hates Monopoly, loves the game.  I can get my 5 year old to play with me with some simplified rules- we don't deal with money.  Just grow and gobble corporations.",Commence egomaniacal laughter

Male,71,36.08,46,1014,PhD,EN,Web,6215,"I grew up playing Monopoly.  Lots of people did.  It's unfortunate, because there was this gem just sitting there, begging to be played, but passed over.  Here's what was missed:

THEME
The game is about buying and selling stock in hotel chains, causing chains to merge, and go in and out of business.  Given that virtually NONE of this is represented visually and it looks more like a Bingo board, the theme really stands out.  You really feel like you're doing exactly what the game says you are.

COMPONENTS
This is where the game takes a hit.  If you can, see if you can pick up one of the versions from the 1960's or 1970's.  Those were VERY well made and, as long as you don't need them to be in perfect shape, can be come across for very little.  If you can get one of those, the components are perfectly good.

GAMEPLAY
You have a handful of tiles marked like a bingo board and one central ""bingo board.""  Every turn, you play a tile to the corresponding spot on the board.  If it is adjacent to another tile that isn't already a company, you get to start a new company.  If it's adjacent to another company, that company just grows.  If it's on its' own, nothing happens.  You can then buy some stock in companies which exist, draw back up to a full hand of tiles, and turn progresses.

SOUNDS BASIC, WHAT MAKES THIS SPECIAL?
Glad you asked.  There's a few twists:

1) There's a chart which shows the value of a company and the price of its' stock.  The more tiles a company is, the more it's worth, and the more it costs to buy stock.  So, you want to invest more in a company, but also want to grow it?  You either need to wait until next turn to grow it (during which, everyone else gets a shot at it) or you need to grow it now and pay more.

2) When 2 companies' tiles touch, they merge.  Having the most (and 2nd most) stock gets you cash bonuses, and then you can keep the stock for the company (as it might open back up) or trade it in for money or other stock.  Being in the right spot to take advantage of those is a HUGE component to the game.

3) After a company gets so large, it becomes ""safe"" in that it can't be bought out anymore.  Getting in on the stock of safe companies is huge, because those companies just keep growing and growing, getting more and more valuable.

SO WHY SHOULD I PLAY THIS INSTEAD OF MONOPOLY
A few reasons:

1) There's a fairly small rule set, so anyone old and smart enough to pick up on strategy for Monopoly can pick this up.

2) It teaches the same principles of investing in the right things at the right time.  Only unlike Monopoly, you don't have so much money that you can just buy everything.  You need to make a choice of what and when to buy.

3) There's still an amount of randomness, and you might have things to do even when it's not your turn.

4) It's a MUCH shorter game.  The game ends when either one company grows too far or every company on the board is ""safe.""  Generally, this is about 45 mins or so, unlike Monopoly, which can last 2-3 hours.

5) For kids, it is a much better teaching tool.  It can still teach addition/subtraction just as well, only now it can teach multiplication (""I'm selling 5 shares for 300 a share, how much is that?""), and chance in investments (every investment isn't always a good one).

6) There's no electronic version with a debit card.

FINAL THOUGHTS
Acquire is a very good, fairly short, light-medium weight game.  It's good for a wide range of ages and, especially compared to it's age and what other board games were at the time, it's incredibly well-designed and strategic.","Acquire, the game you SHOULD be playing instead of Monopoly"

Don't ask me why...I haven't had my coffee yet this morning.

Acquire: 3-6 Players, Ages 12+, Average Play Time: 60 to 90 Minutes

*Note: While the box says that the game is for three to six players, I don't see why a two player variant couldn't exist...if one doesn't already. I'm fairly confident that two players with an imagination who are not concerned about following the rulebook to the letter could make do. I also came across the older Avalon Hill version's rulebook and there is a section for special rules for two players...so feel free to experiment.

Acquire plays a bit differently than the other games I've played. The closest comparison I could possibly make to what I've already reviewed is Airlines Europe. In both games, you're buying stock and whoever has more of certain stocks / colors often reaps the biggest reward when payouts occur. More on that in a minute.

Version & Components

The version of Acquire I purchased is the latest print of the game, by Wizards of the Coast.

I need to get this pet peeve of mine out of the way before I begin. The player tile trays are made of fairly cheap cardboard that you have to punch out and bend to make the pieces assemble. In other words, I had a fun time trying to assemble the player tile trays. In most games I've purchased, tile trays came assembled and were of much better quality.

Some people may not mind the extra work and the game is fairly cheaper than your average Euro-style board game, but c'mon...would it have hurt profits that much to just make the components a little better? Also, the player reference tables were part of the manual itself that I had to cut / tear out. For OCD people like me, the manual just doesn't look right now that pages look torn out of it. I don't see why they couldn't have printed reference sheets separate of the manual.

Previous versions of the game were much nicer looking and of better quality, so much in fact that other reviewers recommend trying to find those older printed versions as opposed to this one. I don't mind average to poor production values if the price is right, but this is just pushing it.

Game Mechanics

The game board is made of up of squares that form a grid, going from 1A in the upper left hand corner all the way to 12I in the lower right hand corner. To the left of the grid are the available corporations that players can form and to the right is the same reference chart you'll find in the cutouts in the back of the manual.

In Acquire, turns are fairly simple. Players place a tile, players buy up to three stocks, and finally players pick up a new tile from the supply. Tiles correspond to the squares / grid on the board...for example...you'd place the 1A tile if you had it onto the 1A square on the board / grid.

When a player places a tile next to an existing tile sitting by itself, that player gets to form a corporation. It doesn't become their's mind you, but they do get a free stock card for establishing it. That player can choose any of the available corporations...though some grow differently than others. Some corporations are cheap to buy stocks for early on but don't pay out as much when they grow in size while others are expensive to buy stocks for early on but payout is big in the endgame.

Players continue placing tiles, forming / growing corporations, and buying stock cards until a tile is placed that causes two corporations to bump heads. This is the real meat and potatoes of the game. A few things happen when this occurs.

1) The larger corporation acquires or ""eats up"" the smaller one. If the purple corporation for example had six tiles and green had three tiles, purple would acquire green. The exception to the rule is if both corporations are eleven tiles are higher in size. Corporations with eleven tiles or more are considered ""safe.""

2) The player who owns the most stock cards in the company that was acquired gains the one time majority shareholder bonus. The amount varies depending on how big the corporation actually is. The player who owns the second most stock cards of the company that was acquired receives the one time minority shareholder bonus. Sorry, but there isn't a prize here for third place, unless there is a tie for second place.

3) Players who own stock in the company that was acquired have a choice to make.

- They can sell their stock for cash now, the amount depending on how big the corporation is.

- They can trade that stock on a 2 to 1 basis for stock of the company that acquired it.

- They can keep their stock, hoping the corporation will form again down the line.

The acquired company marker gets put back to its place on the side of the board and can be formed again later on.

At the end of the game, shareholder bonuses are given out to the companies that are on the board and their stocks are traded in for cash. The winner is the player with the most money after that is all said and done.

The Review

All three kids joined me to form a four player game. Explaining the rules wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. I was concerned that the whole buying stocks and acquiring would overwhelm the eleven year old, but ironically he ended up winning the game. He randomly bought stock so that he'd try to have more than everyone else, which ended up working out to his advantage unbeknownst to him.

I focused on buying stocks for two corporations in the middle of the board and would have made a lot of money had one acquired the other...but they ended up becoming ""safe"" and I didn't have much money left to buy stocks in other corporations that could still be acquired. I received a nice bonus at the end of the game for all the stock I had, but my son used the money he earned from his acquisitions to buy even more stock than what I had bought up cheaply in the beginning of the game...so he ended up getting the majority shareholder bonus anyway. He earned so much from a particular acquisition that he just started buying out ALL of the stock cards of particular colors until there were none left.

It seems to pay to have money throughout the game and not to focus on one or two corporations, unless you are sure they will pay out. I was tempted to offer him a later bed time if he'd slip me ten grand, but I thought better of it. The game took us about two hours to play...keep in mind, there was a learning curve and three kids of varying ages involved.

Overall, I really enjoyed the game. Acquire is simple enough to learn but deep enough that players can form strategies in order to outdo the other. The random tile placement throughout the game by players keeps the replayability high. I quickly forgot about the quality of the player tile trays when I started playing out scenarios in my head on how certain corporations might play out on the board.

The kids were actively working out aloud which corporations they planned to grow and were constantly comparing how many stock cards they had of certain colors. They were often on the edge of their seats when a merger occured...anxious to see how it would play out. The older ones took it a step further and bought out stock in the growing corporations, recognizing how much money they could make when it grows even bigger. The younger one just bought what he could afford and random chance worked in his favor. They all stated that they enjoyed playing the game.

I personally recommend Acquire if you enjoy games with a financial theme to them, in this case, stocks and money. I recommend that players have a calculator handy, especially for the endgame. The poor production values (when compared to versions previous to it) might turn some people off, but I'd recommend putting that aside in your mind to enjoy the game for what it really is.",Acquire Review by Dad's Gaming Addiction

However, the quality of the materials of this product are terrible now.  Instead of a durable plastic grid board for which the tiles are played upon in older versions of the game, you now get this cheesy piece of cardboard.  The pricing information for each company is no longer an individual card given to each player for reference.  There is only one and it's imbedded into the cardboard playing grid - so it's a real strain for everyone to view.

I really wanted to rate this at least 4 stars, but the durability of this game and ease of play forces me to downgrade the overall rating.

Gameplay:  Wow, I love this game!  I cannot believe with all the gamers I know that no one else has ever played this.  Way better than Monopoly, much quicker with layers of subtlety and depth that make this easy to learn and very hard to master.  My gaming group always seems to find the time to play a round of Aquire every time we get together.  The hardest part I have found is adjusting your strategy depending on the number of players as this will change how you approach your buying and takeovers.

Components:  I have seen many complaints about the quality of the components of this version, and many of them are founded and some I think are exaggerated a bit.  The cheapest component are the tile holders, definately seen better there.  The tiles themselves are quite sturdy and although they do not lock down like previous editions I don't have that much of an issue with them moving all over the board.  The stock certificate cards are quite good, though a bit more color variety would be nice. The Worldwide, American, and Tower stocks are a little too close in color to each other.

Overall I say this is a great game, certainly one of my new all time favorites.

The game itself, however, is a fantastic and challenging source of entertainment. A game of strategy on the level of ""Risk"" players must build and invest in ""corporations"" which are then acquired by larger corporations in a continually changing landscape which enables the game to be unique each time it is played. Players must decide which stock to buy and carefully strategize in order to maintain a continuous cash flow and obtain majority stockholder positions in order to achieve a big payout in the end.

Acquire is a game about investing in hotel chains and getting the most money in the end, similar to Monopoly, but that is about where the similarity ends.  The game does a wonderful job of creating the experience of investing in stock, simulating growth in value as the hotel chain grows, merging, and fighting to be primary stockholder for huge payouts on mergers.  The gameplay is brilliantly simple, but the strategy and decision making can go way deep!  It is done in such a way that the word elegance comes to mind. Even though there is luck involved in the way you draw tiles for this game, I at least get to choose where I want to move by placing a tile. Whereas in Monopoly, you have to move where the die tells you (roll 'n move) which aggravates me.

In this game you perform 3 simple actions: place a tile, buy up to three stocks, and then draw another tile. When I place a tile, I can decide if I want help grow a hotel chain(don't have to own it), create a hotel chain, or merge a hotel chain.  After that, I have to decide on which hotel chain on the board I want to buy stock.  This is where things get interesting, because you know that if you own the most stock in a hotel chain that gets gobbled up in a merger, you'll get some major moolah.  Of course the bigger the chain is when it gets gobbled, the bigger the payout is. So, you may finding yourself trying to weigh out when you should merge the hotel chain if someone doesn't do it first and whether or not you grow it.  Again, there's a risk involved, because if a hotel chain gets beyond 11 tiles, it is safe from acquisition.  If that happens and you're a major stockholder, then you'll keep growing that ""safe"" hotel chain for the big payout at the end of the game.  When mergers happen, you also have to decide if you should trade your stock in for the new hotel, sell your old stock, or keep it for when you decide to start the old chain back up again.  The game has a lot of subtle strategy as you try to weigh out how you grow a hotel chain or merge it, based on how much stock you own in it or how much someone else has invested in it.

Acquire is just a beautifully designed game and is a lot of fun to play.  This is a great way to teach your kids about investing in stock too!","Really, no matter how it's made, it's a great game! Better than Monopoly!"

It's a bit confusing to switch between the two since some hotels with the same name have different values, but it's not too tough to make the adjustment.

Games are improved by the tactile: the feel of teh pieces in your hand, the way they work on the board, their physicality. This new edition was clearly designed by someone who just doesnt play board games. Sadly, its just cheap.","Sadly, its just cheap"
Male,69,50.84,59,1904,PhD,EN,Web,283,"Acquire has always been a fun game. I have collected versions of Acquire from 1st release to present release. I guess I'm a collector as well as an avid player. I have to say though that the latest version of the game has much to be desired in terms of quality. The game hasn't changed so for new players that are interested go out and get it and enjoy it. However if you are an avid player of the game for years, this is the cheapest product quality of all the versions. It's no longer plastic, it's all card board. Every piece from the board to the titles is card board. So if you are looking for a version to just take with you wherever you go and not have to worry about damaging it then get this one because you can always just buy another version and replace it.

So in short, it's the same game it's always been. It's a cheap board with cheap pieces to bring down the cost of the product. I think if Hasbro ever releases this game again they should spend a bit more time on quality durable design and go back to plastic pieces. They should also attempt to make a travel version of the game. I'm personally working on a design for that very purpose. Who knows, maybe with a lot of luck Hasbro might pick it up and use the design. If anyone is going to design a better board then it's the fans of the game.",The Acquire Tradition - Though Cheaper

It seams like the person with no high value stocks ends up the winner and you you go huu? how did that happen? The only this that is annoying is that you run out of stock cards and no one can buy anymore or trade out when the company is bought out.

The new version is a huge disappointment. The tiles, trays to hold each player's tiles, and the tiles that indicate a hotel are all cardboard. Worse, they are cardboard that you will have to pop out of a card.

The earlier versions had a board to hold the tiles that had a slot for each tile, which was much more effective.

With the current version, the tiles slide around the board dont' stay in place.

There is no place to hold the cash, so in the box it just slides around. There is no scoring card.

The shares for each hotel chain are very fancily printed, but the printing is so fancy that it is hard to tell which hotel chain the share is for without reading carefully. A simple use of color would have fixed this.

Female,38,54.94,40,1536,graduate,EN,Web,2874,"If you have never played, don't let the reviews turn you off. This is a wonderful, mind working game.

Many people liked the version with the 3-d peices because they don't get bumped... but if you play on a table and aren't trying to hold a baby at the same time or have a cat that likes to jump on games (which are valid concerns), then this version will do fine. I'm not really certain why some people keep buying each version, unless they collect or their old one is worn out from many a good time.

I personally have been waiting for a ""flat""version. I found that the 3-d version was unnecessarily bulky (they could have made a better ""locking system"" if they wanted a bump free version), the pieces were too big to throw into a drawstring bag and draw from (I'd rather not have to turn them all upside down and then make room for all the bulky upside down pieces to take up half my table), and the peices were too bulky to easily conceal from the other players.. we had to all get shoe boxes, or keep them upside down and remember exactly which pieces we had.

So all and all, I actually prefer this one. You will have a distinct advantage if you have the type of mind that can keep track of how many of what each player buys.

Not the best to play with young players because decisions they make can effect everyone else... which is good if they fully understand why they are doing it and what effect it will have, but if they don't, then it really is a bummer when they mess things up for you (and it doesn't even help them).",I didn't like the 3d version anyway

However, the quality of the game was sub par. Nearly all of the pieces were a cheap cardboard, and as others have noted, nothing holds the pieces on the board in place. I kept thinking why had the game publisher thought adopting a similar design to scrabble, a raised, indented board that could be turned, plastic piece holders, a black bag to hold the pieces so players could retrieve new tiles, better construction on the 'cost cards'.

Unlike many other games in the genre, this game is fully cooperative.  There's no solo player controlling the dungeon and the monsters.  Because of that however, there is going to be a bit of reading involved in any play session.  Players end up controlling monsters on their turns as well as acting for their hero character.  The monsters however follow a set of instructions located on each of their cards, sort of like a simple AI computer program.  It works out fairly easily and is a lot of fun.

There's an adventure book which outlines the different scenarios for the game and it can combine with the other game(s) in the D&D Boardgame series for more play options.

Male,41,58.22,35,1463,graduate,EN,Web,10196,"I was skeptical about 'Castle Ravenloft' despite it having received mostly glowing reviews so I decided to skip it when it was released last Fall. Having played a lot of Dungeon and Dragons Miniatures 2.0 [DDM 2.0] 'til it died in 2008 [and kept alive via fans and members of the design team, some of whom worked on CR and Wrath of Ashardalon [WoA] and enjoyed D&D and AD&D from the original Gygax offerings thru 4th Edition, I wasn't sure if this self-contained boardgame would offer enough entertainment variety for me and my fantasy RPG combat-heavy loving friends. Having read all of the positive reviews on Amazon as well as other sites including ars technica and mtv.com of all places, I felt as if I was duty bound to acquire this game for some reason. The main draw for me was that it contained additional elements beyond what was offered in CR [which again, I hadn't played].

Once I received WoA, I couldn't have been happier that I took the plunge! The quality of the gamepieces and punchout tiles and tokens are top notch. The last time I purchased a boardgame was September of 2009 when Games Workshop re-released their latest anniversary edition of Space Hulk; that was an exceptional product overall and cost $100. D&D: WoA felt nearly equal in quality once I removed everything from the confines of its ginormous box; pretty good for something that cost less than $50 via Amazon.com!

I've played several of the included adventures with people whose ages ranged from 8 (my eldest son) to 38, some with boardgame or RP/miniatures skirmish based experience and some with none at all; it was very easy to introduce the rules to all of them and in every instance we all had a great time. Some of the people I 'snookered' into playing this were sold on the concept that they would essentially be playing a tangible, 3-D ver. of the classic game 'Gauntlet' or Rogue-like dungeon crawlers that are still popular today [on phones or the DS/PSP, etc.]. It's greatest strength is probably due to the fact that it's a co-operative game; we all definitely enjoyed the pressure of meeting the required goals and succeeding at them, yet also each having the ability to deter us all from completing those goals due to every Encounter card draw or Monster/Villain action per player's turns.

I've since received D&D: Castle Ravenloft as a gift, and have come to enjoy that tremendously as well. I look forward to future game sessions where we'll mix and match the components of either game. D&D: The Legend of Drizz't can't come out soon enough....",Dungeons and Dragons: Wrath of Ashardalon is Top Notch!
Male,38,58.22,95,3866,postgraduate,EN,Web,10232,"This game is a lot of fun and a good improvement on the Castle Ravenloft game. So far I've only played a few hours solo, but it's been very enjoyable. The new monster tactics, chambers, and doors add a lot to the system started with Ravenloft.

If you're looking for a fun co-op or solo game, this is what you are looking for.

The game works by drawing interlocking dungeon tiles randomly to create a new dungeon each time. Most adventures have you place an objective tile in your tile deck. Then when you lay down that objective tile, the adventure rules tells you what happens (usually a boss battle).

The game comes with 13 adventures, but it's super easy to make your own. Or if you just want to kill some monsters, throw a chamber tile in your dungeon tile deck and when you explore to that chamber tile, draw a chamber card to see what happens.

The components all seem very high quality. There have been complaints of warped cards, but I haven't experienced it yet (even after spilling beer all over my cleric's ability cards). People who have complained to Wizards of the Coast about warped cards are reporting that they have received replacement decks.

Great game for friends, family and for yourself.",Great game
Male,58,58.22,11,463,postgraduate,EN,Web,10240,"Wrath of Ashardalon gets everything right for a dungeon crawl board game. I'll break down all of the great highlights:

Set-Up
------
You divide out cards and characters. You put a start tile down, then you're ready to go. Super easy and fast.

Rules
-----
If you are familiar with playing Dungeons and Dragons, then you'll know that an encounter can often take more than an hour. Not so here.

The rules have been laid out to make encounters very brief. And you won't feel cheated. All of the rolls are with 20-sided dice. Damage is 1, 2 or 3 hit points. Almost everything has between 1-12 hit points. So creature die fast.

Each player adds more of a challenge. So if you solo, it's just as hard as with 5 people (more or less -- I think it's just a tad harder with more people). So as you add more people, their ability to play their role becomes crucial (fighters fight, clerics heal, wizards blast from afar, etc).

The rules roughly follow the 4.0 version of the Dungeons and Dragons rules. You have daily, utility and at-will powers. Swinging a sword is at-will, blasting something with a powerful fireball is daily.

You collect experience as you kill creatures. If you kill something with a roll of 20 and you have 5 experience points in monsters, then you can level up your character to gain more hit points, less chance of being hit and more powers.

Quests are found in a quest book that tells you how to set up the game and who the boss is. The end of most quests have a boss that will take a lot to kill.

Durability
----------
The game is very well made. The plastic is hard enough to not break after thorough use. The cardboard pieces are very dense and thick.

Our cards warped a little one a humid night, but it wasn't horrible.

Nerd-Factor
-----------
This game had far less nerdness than regular D&D. But it also doesn't have some of the fun aspects of role-playing (like a long, emmersive and interactive storyline). You can feel safe to invite people over to play who are not Dungeons & Dragons addicts.

Minitaures
----------
All of the pieces are very detailed. Some look identical to the D&D 4.0 creatures and characters that are sold for the miniatures game. However, none of these pieces are painted. They are all one solid (or translucent) color.

Fun Factor
----------
Since the game has no need for a Dungeon Master or someone to play the enemy, everyone can enjoy playing on the same team. And you'll rarely have mathematical discussions of how to absolutely maximize every turn in order to survive (a common occurance in many other dungeon crawls, e.g. Descent:  Journey into the Darkness).

So, overall, it's just a good time with a bunch of friends. Win or lose, you'll enjoy the comraderie of tearing through baddies and collecting treasure.

Replayability
-------------
The game offers tons of quests and there's practically in infinite number more online. You could also just make up your own quests. The randomization of encounter and treasure cards keeps things changing. And you can add more heroes, treasure cards, encounter cards and quests by purchasing Ravenloft or the coming Legends of Drizzt board game.

Overall
-------
This is the best dungeon crawl game I've ever played. I find it difficult to imagine something working out better.

Admittedly, I enjoyed this game even more when I played with the cards from Ravenloft added into it. Some of the skills in this game don't synergize very well together, but they do with the Ravenloft game. I have a feeling that Wizards of the Coast did that on purpose.","A fast, enjoyable board game"

Male,45,58.22,9,385,graduate,EN,Web,10270,"Ideally, it's a 5 stars D&D board game as the pervious one Dungeons & Dragons: Castle Ravenloft Board Game for most first time D&D board game players.

The way to play is just like Dungeons & Dragons: Castle Ravenloft Board Game, but it added some more new features such as GP for purchase items, NPC status, and chamber cards for quests.

I like it, but I do have some disappointments as an old player for D&D board game.

1. Monster level is still up to level 6, and character level is only up to level 2, so it's a still short game as before.  There is no exciting part on the leveling point of view.  If they can make monster level up to 8 or more, and provide charcater cards for both current and pervious version heros, and all heros levels are up to level 3.  It will have more fun and make a this advanture to combine with pervious one even better.

2. Monsters... Top two monsters are the same as before like a big dragon plus a key monster.  Little monsters quantity is only up to 3 as maximum.  So, the formula is totally the same as pervious one.  It didn't proivde new exciting challenge to me.  I was hope this advanture having some different scenarios such as my hero to be surranded by more a big group of orc, goblin, or what else evil monsters on my way searching the secrect of wrath of ashardalon, but the maximum is 3......

After we received it and play 5 hours...  I have to say... It's a good game, and it should have 5 stars as Castle Ravenloft; however, it doesn't include enough features as a 2nd D&D board game for players who played Castle Ravenloft and look for more.  It's a game with almost the same formula like pervious one via adding few new features, but not that exciting.  It doesn't provide a good way to combine both D&D board games together making more fun for old players, so I would like to give it 4 stars instead of 5.","Nice new advanture, but not much difference..."
Male,39,58.22,75,3082,postgraduate,EN,Web,10281,"I got the chance to play this board game last night, and I found it to be a much polished follow up to their earlier board game, ""Dungeons & Dragons: Castle Ravenloft Board Game"".  You do not need to own or have plaid Ravenloft to play and enjoy this game.  In fact, I consider this a superior product.

First and foremost it comes with a wide variety of plastic miniatures, these are the same soft minis they release for their separate miniatures line meaning they won't chip or break, but also are unsuitable for traditional miniature painting.  They are unpainted, but the plastic color for each is chosen to denote the power and theme of the monster (red for demons, grey for duergar and so forth).

The artwork on the tiles is well done, and the tiles themselves are solidly constructed.  There is a huge variety of tokens and cards for all situations in the game, these are all competently put together.  If I had to pick 1 complaint, and it would be minor, it is that there are too many different varieties of tokens, and unless you put together some sort of sorting mechanism (plastic baggies work fine) it's easy to get the things you are looking for lost in a pile of tokens.

Gameplay starts by choosing a scenario from the included booklet, which includes everything you need to know to set up this particular adventure.  The scenarios increase in difficulty as you go along, but do not require continuity to play, so if you have a favorite you can jump right there.  Everybody plays, there is no person running this game for the players, it is entirely player driven.  Exploration occurs by drawing random tiles, which are accompanied by monsters and random encounters.

One fun touch are environment cards which are ambient effects that remain in play until another is drawn.  These range from an increase in the number of monsters drawn to walls of magma.  Players control the monsters they place, which are driven by simple scripts telling you what they do in clearly defined situations (if they are far away, move them up, if they are near attack, etc, etc.)

The rules system will be very familiar to anybody who has played 4th edition D&D, but simple enough for newcomers to grasp.  Once the game gets going, it quickly cascades giving a real feel of desperation without becoming unmanageable.  The random encounters and events are fairly well balanced, and I found this to be a solid game.

You get enough nice cardboard tiles to make some simple dungeons with. The miniatures were mostly in good shape, the moulds used are detailed and the monster variety is good. Some of the bases on the the bigger models seemed a little bent. If you are planning on painting these, you were probably already planning on putting new bases on anyway.

As for the actual game itself, I don't know. I tried playing the single player scenario and the book and it seemed incredibly simple and boring to me. The 4th Ed. D&D rules have been stripped down so much that this is D&D in name and flavour only really. The huge blocks of cards that come with the game, aren't really that attractive and it would take some heavy modifying to get them to where they were usable in an actual game of D&D.

For 50 bucks I got a nice stack of dungeon tiles and big bag of around 40 miniatures. Overall I'm pleased and I've decided to purchase Ravenloft now too.

The tokens and tiles included are also top notch, very durable and don't feel flimsy. Aside from that, the game is just an extremely good time with friends. The rules are simple, but the gameplay never feels mundain or boring due to great monster design and the awesome encounter system.

A little confusing but probably easier to grasp for people who have never played a traditional RPG.",A bargain for the miniatures alone! The game itself is a bonus!
Male,57,72.16,15,787,graduate,EN,Web,3403,"This is a standalone D&D themed board game that you can play with 1 to 5 players. Yes, that means you can play the game by yourself, and I recommend doing so the first time you play so that you can get a handle of the rules and be in a better position to help others in the future. This single player aspect is actually what drew me towards this game. I love D&D, and I love board games, but my wife only occasionally plays games. So this was something I could play on my own. However, I was a bit disappointed that in the scenario booklet that comes with the game there is only a single scenario for 1 player. All of the others say you need at least two people. Bummer.

That aside, the tiles and cards are all excellent quality and I have confidence that they'll hold up well. I was truly impressed with this. Conversely, I was a bit disappointed in the figures. They're made of a soft plastic which is fine for the more solid figures, but doesn't work so well with things like swords that end up being really flimsy and bent in odd angles. They're not poorly made, I'm just not sure the soft plastic is a better choice over a hard plastic.

The game itself is extremely challenging. And I mean *really* hard. I'm sure there are harder games out there, but this is by far the most challenging board game I have ever played. Every single turn you are under attack, there is never any rest. More often than not, you will be under attack from two different sources *every* turn in the form of a monster and an encounter card. Each monster you kill gives you experience which you can 'spend' to counter the encounter cards, but you need 5 exp to do so and monsters give 1-3 exp each and generally take at least 2 turns to kill each and that's if you hit both turns. So, you can counter 1 encounter card every 4+ turns (usually more like 6) however, you also need 5 exp to 'level up' your characters which you can only do if you roll a 20 or get a special treasure card.

My family all found the challenge of this game to be just too much. As an example if you're playing a cleric, who in D&D wears heavy armor and usually a shield, has an AC of 16. Well, most enemies have a +7 to +11 to their attack. That means they have a 60-80% chance of hitting you, and many enemies cause a 'dazed' or 'poisoned' trait to also be added. You don't even want to know about weaker armored units. Numerous encounters and enemies will also do damage even if they do miss (just less than if they hit). Because of these insanely high chances your characters are pretty much *always* loosing health. If even a single hero dies, it's game over. We haven't been able to win a single game yet. Clearly something isn't 'clicking' with anyone of us on just how to win at this game, but the result is that none of us enjoy playing the game and it's now collecting dust.

I can only recommend this game to people who enjoy a tough challenge and want every scenario they play to be a nail biting experience.","Good quality, extreamly challenging"

Female,39,79.54,32,1797,graduate,EN,Web,4415,"Loads of fun. If you've played any of the other D&D boardgames, this is more of the same. This set (Wrath of Ashardalon), in my opinion, is the most well-rounded among them all. It includes gold tokens which you can spend on buying treasures between adventures, a balanced set of heroes with memorable and unique abilities without being overpowered so as to make the game too easy, and the most relatable setting.

For those of you who haven't played the other boardgames, you don't have to own them all. Each one is a standalone game, but the rules, board pieces, cards, and characters are all interchangeable with each other. This game is a dungeon crawl, where each turn you explore a new room of the dungeon and deal with the things you find there - be it a monster, a trap, an encounter, or any/all of the above.

It's fully co-operative; there is no need for one player to be a dungeon master who plays by different rules from the others and acts as the ""villain,"" so you can even play this game solo if you really wanted to. The ""AI"" or rules for each of the monsters that you encounter in the game is determined by its card, so you don't have to worry about making people feel like they're being singled out (i.e. this game won't break friendships unlike Risk or Monopoly).

It's very approachable and you don't have to have ever played a game of Dungeons and Dragons to understand or even appreciate it. On the other hand, this could actually be a great way to introduce people to D&D if you're so inclined, as the rules are distilled and simplified versions of the actual tabletop roleplaying game.

The components are well manufactured and will likely last for many a playthrough, the system is simple and pretty easy to master. Beyond that, it's just mediocre at best. The gameplay is shallow, lacking anything but the most superficial of narratives, the character development/leveling and the combat system are oversimplified to the point of dullness, the environments are monotone, and the theme is superficial. Markers and tiles just feel lifeless and nothing compels the player to keep playing once the thrill of repeatedly rolling a d20 (the ONLY die in the game) wears off (which probably already has or you wouldn't be reading this). Little flexibility in character customization, no damage randomization, a shoehorned encounter system that typically throws out non-sequitur attacks and penalties, and lackluster scenarios that read like 7th grade recess fiction. I will say that the minis included in this game are well modeled and of good quality. I think this is where the game gets its five star ratings. Once the thrill of opening and looking at a box of toys wears off, though, you are left holding one intensely flat gaming experience bag. I'd recommend looking elsewhere for a solid dungeon crawler, because this one is just not quite it.","It's pretty meh, sadly."

I never played D&D for those very reasons, but after doing some research on this game, I found out that you can play solo. There are 13 adventues included, and the replay value is high since the adventures are unfolded differently each time by how the dungeon tiles are shuffled, along with the creature/treasure/encounter cards. The rule book is thankfully thin, and is mostly clear with it's delivery. There are a ton of pieces, but as long as you have some sandwich bags, you should be ok.

So far I've completed the first adventure, and I like how they didn't throw all of the rules at you (locked doors, for example).

I also like the idea of taking the components from the other 3 games and putting them together for one giant adventure.

I subtracted a star just because the tokens and pieces should have been organized in bags, and some of the rules seem confusing (but not enough to distract the player from having fun).

Female,34,84.46,69,3880,diploma,EN,Web,3711,"With tons of replay value, this tense, cooperative adventure has quickly became one of my favorite casual games. You would think that, without a DM, the pacing wouldn't flow, but the designers were clever in forcing you to keep exploring to avoid hazards and traps. You never know what could be slithering around the corner.

What I love is how customizable it is. Yes, you should follow the rules to a T, but you can also shuffle in pieces from other D&D board games like Castle Ravenloft and Legend of Drizzt. Doing so can create massive mazes of randomized monsters. If you're getting even more invested, create your own heroes and villains from scratch by rolling in Reaper or other mini figures. You also get a horde of miniature figurines that would otherwise cost $50 so the value is well worth it.

Male,24,16.4,79,701,graduate,EN,Web,231,"I wish I'd watched some of the gameplay videos of Ashardalon before buying. As others have mentioned, it's not an RPG, it's a board game. But as a board game, it's a particularly bad boardgame. It's punishingly difficult, and there is little theme. It begs for house rules to clean up the terrible Encounter Card system.

I tried playing aggressively, and was quickly overwhelmed with critters to kill. I tried playing cautiously, and my party was wrecked by encounter cards. It just doesn't feel like a proper dungeon crawl if you've killed five monsters and lost half of your characters' HP before you've left sight of the staircase. It's more like a combat game set in a wacky arena where bad stuff happens all the time. Seen another way, it is like a puzzle game, where you have to balance risk (generally too much) against reward (generally too little), and hopefully survive long enough to reach the objective. But in no way does it feel like a dungeon crawl. And, importantly, it's a poor introduction to RPG elements.

But clearly I am in the minority; this is a well-reviewed game. I simply wish to offer a dissenting opinion. To me, Ashardalon is not fun to play.

I'm selling my copy and I'm going to try Mice and Mystics instead. That looks more like what I was hoping Ashardalon would be, with a balance of teen-friendly story, adventure, and combat, with no need for a DM. I'm also eager to try Arcadia Quest.

Male,33,20.5,73,982,PhD,EN,Web,1970,"the two notable negatives to this latest round of DnD-lite releases are:

1 - discouragingly varied element of 'randomness' - negative experiences that the players could not possibly have anticipated, accommodated, or dealt with. sometimes you just get stuck in a room full of lava with enemies that repeatedly paralyze you and your one chance to heal yourself fails.

2 - there's no real 'role playing' involved here - it's RPG--style combat, and your characters have some stats and equippable items, but you're just playing with 'pawns' in the end - no in-game incentives to actually include a story or 'play' a character.

both of these shortcomings can easily be addresses with some judicious house-ruling or one of the players stepping up to 'play' the role of the DM (a position ostensibly unnecessary in this game) - but it's worth noting that out-of-the-box, these two elements do seem lacking.

Now - all that aside - this is a super fun and 'lite' way to get into an RPG tactics battle game, sort of an excellent introduction to larger scale miniature war games or more story-based RPG adventure scenarios, and it comes with a surprisingly useful collection of figures (the big boss characters are pretty rad) - as long as you know what you're sitting down to, it can really be a lot of fun to play.",both of these shortcomings can easily be addresses with some judicious house-ruling or one of ...

I'm extremely happy with this game.  High quality, not very high, pieces: the minis look great, the tiles are wonderful, the cards are great.  It's a very fun game, and I enjoy it just as much by myself than when I play with a full group.

A couple negative things, but not too big, in my opinion, are due to packaging, some of the minis with swords or objects that stick out away from the mini can be bent when you open them.  This doesn't bother me that much, but I could see it bothering people who enjoy painting minis.  Another negative remark is the rulebook leaves a lot of gray area in certain situations during gameplay.  This isn't so bad if you can improvise a way around it, but it can definitely slow down play, and creates a lot of confusion.

Overall, this is a great value buy.  I don't think you can 30+ minis of this quality anywhere for this price, and the Ashardalon mini is beautiful.  I love this set.","Great game, great value."

Rules leave a little to the imagination witch is a bit frustrating when it comes to board games like this. Not that you'd expect EVERYTHING to have been answered, but there are some empty spaces in the rules that just slow down the game when you can't find what you're looking for and have to ""vote"" on it.

It's been mentioned before, but the tiles are ultra bland. All gray squares or brown squares. Not at all pretty. Functional, but ugly. Also, I tire of the excessive use of ""customized"" counters in these games. TONS of little pieces to keep track of in baggies that would better benefit as extra dice in the box or some form of spinner to dial in my HP. Get creative on how you track consumables in WoA and you'll save yourself some grief. My wife and I use appropriate size dice for health instead of handfuls of ""HP"" chips.

All in all still a really fun game. Minis look pretty good. I think the makers of Descent put more effort in their product in terms of miniature and dungeon tile quality/detail, but that's a competitive game. Get this if you like co-op dungeon crawling.

Female,53,38.54,59,1681,postgraduate,EN,Web,9635,"If you are a fan of Dungeons and Dragons or other adventure/exploration games, you should definitely give WoA a try.  My two kids (13 & 15) and  I have not been able to stop playing since we got this.  The game requires no ""Dungeon Master"" and it pits you and your friends against the dungeon beasts.  Several scenarios can be chosen to launch the game, and these varying in difficulty and duration.  We found that the first two scenarios were more about learning the flow of the game, but things really got fun in the third scenario (first one that used the chamber tiles).

The game comes with predetermined heroes, from which each player chooses.  Each has unique abilities, with cards to remind you of the damage, healing or characteristic of abilities.  The dungeon is created from tiles that are randomly selected as the game progresses.  Each dungeon tile explored has either a random monster, random encounter, or both.  Monsters are ""handled"" by the player that drew them, but they come with an attack strategy.  While the monster cards are not that great to look at, they do give a fairly detailed attack strategy that allows the player to determine which hero the monster attacks or other actions a monster may do (ex. Kobolds love to go looking for help from their friends).  The monster and hero figures are high quality, but are unpainted.  If you desire to paint the figures, do some web searching and you will quickly find a vast community of gamers willing to help you.  My kids and I were ecstatic to find that our monsters from the Dungeon Command series were compatible with WoA.  Mixing our monster cards from Dungeon Command into the monster deck from WoA makes things even more challenging.  There's nothing more intimidating than revealing you chamber monsters and realizing you have to face an Ogre and a Dracolich, along with the baddies already in play.

I do have a few minor complaints.  The box is IMPRESSIVE and high quality.  The choice of heroes is a bit strange, and I wish they'd included male and female version of both.  The instructions manuals are printed on thin paper, and given the extremely high quality of the other components, they definitely should have made the manuals more durable.  The artwork on the monster cards is boring compared to those from the Dungeon Command series.  I wish they would have made the treasures that Increase Armor Class or Attack ""stackable"", so that they were easier to keep track of (as in Dungeon Command).  I may mark my cards along the bottom edge to serve this purpose.

Overall, this is a GREAT game, and well worth the purchase price.  It has given us hours of enjoyment and quality time together, untethered from our electronic devices.  The game lends itself to customization of monster sets allowing the utilization of monsters from other D&D sets (i.e., Dungeon Command).  Although there is no true character design, as the heroes are a predetermined group, with some imagination, there is no reason that you could not design your own hero cards.

Male,65,39.36,51,1355,postgraduate,EN,Web,1577,"I bought the game expecting that if I didn't enjoy the game, it was still a good price for a box full of mini's to use with other games.  But the game if a riot to play.  It's a random draw system based around a few key structures to provide a point to each dungeon crawl.  You could play the same run over and over and it'd probably be a few hundred times before it came up exactly the same.  A sense of desperation, but still not to tough.

It can combine with Castle Ravenloft and The Legend of Drizzt board games, each a stand alone set as well as this one.  A lot of online game modifications if you ever get tired of the main rules.  A few rules to learn, then most of the rules are given on the cards that are used in play.

One nice feature, 1-5 players.  If combined with the other titles, you could potentially play 1-15 players, though that's a lot people for this type of game.  Each player is partially running the game and playing at the same time.  The more players, the more monsters and traps and such, so it scales nicely in difficulty with however many players you have.

My only con about it is, that Ashaldaron(the figure) seemed well it had great detail on it, but the assembling in factory seemed bad or poor. There is a slight gap between the two sections and what appears to be a slight overflow of glue that was used.

Once we adjusted to the scant rulebook in CR (it was very alarming to make up house rules when we were new to the genre), we found the game to be fun and engaging, and it made sense to try out the second version.  WoA shows some obvious improvements over CR.  We found that the health and monsters are balanced better, though it's hard to put my finger on exactly what changed to make it so.  However, in CR, we basically always had to add a house rule for possible health drops after defeating an enemy (we would roll the D20 to determine whether health would or would not drop and then again for how much).  In WoA, we don't have to do that, and we still win often enough to make the game fun and not just punishment.

Now that we have played real D&D, this game feels a little bit weaker.  I see now the depth that I'm missing here, and it's true that actual role playing is hard.  However, I don't think it's fair to blame this game for being watered down D&D.  In fact, I think it's basically marketed to be that way.  By and large, we don't have time for a full D&D campaign with weekly meetings that last for hours at a time.  When those sessions happen, they are more fun than playing WoA or CR, but they don't happen very often.  In the mean time, this provides the opportunity to use all of that magnificent dungeon-crawling lingo and to experience the agony of peaking around a dark corner and finding a cave bear waiting for you.

Overall, I would say that, in many ways, this is a strategy game couched in the slick skin of an RPG.  My husband and I like to work hard to optimize our plans and order our strategies to have the best run-through.  When we play the game with a full party of friends, much chaos and laughter ensue (because, let's face it, five turns per round produce a LOT of monsters and encounter cards).  Yes, we have had to implement house rules occasionally, but the game is still solid even in its original form.  This is a great family game if your family is the right kind of nerdy.  We've played D&D on the computer (Neverwinter Nights), which was a lot of fun.  But, board games are better at bringing people together.  We can play this in a few hours with another couple and enjoy an evening entirely without screens.  I find that to be a benefit.

Oh, and if you need more incentive to buy this game, you can always view it as an investment in another new hobby.  We have taken up painting minis after buying these games, and we have found that the painted figures bring so much more depth to the experience.",A Solid Experience for D&D Light

Great pieces and sturdy construction make for a lot of fun.  I especially liked the more challenging Encounter cards in this game in particular.  Very fun and relatively easy to learn.  There is a bit of reading but once you get though that it is very simple and once you ""get it"" you don't need to really re-read the instructions.  Maybe we went back for clarification once or twice in the first few games, but that was it.

Male,46,44.28,46,1501,diploma,EN,Web,3436,"I was attracted to this game and its counterparts (Castle Ravenloft and Legend of Drizzt) mainly because there is a one-player option. There are plenty of times where I'd like to play but no one is available to play. Single or multi player, it seems to be a solid game.

My only complaints are that the punch out tiles seem to be a BIT less of quality when compared to other big box games like Descent Second Edition. I noticed when I was punching out the tiles, there was a lot of debris on the table. Maybe a poor cut in the sheet, but annoying in any event. They also are prone to tearing if you aren't careful when taking them out. But once they are punched out, they seem to be pretty solid. The playing cards are also a bit thinner than other games. Not too big of a deal since most players buy sleeves for all their cards, so that I can live with. Lastly, the adventure book and rule book are pretty flimsy.

The minis are of great quality and there are a lot of them. Wizards of the Coast never disappoints in this department IMHO.

All in all, if the punch outs are carefully taken out and the cards and books are stored properly, there should be no issue.

The game lasted about 2 hours and we won but only after I made some home rule changes because turns started to get very complicated trying to keep track of which traps were doing what and what effects happened when and if those effects were to end at some point.  Once we just made some rule changes to suit us it was much more enjoyable though.  That being said It was two adults and my autistic 5 year old (me and my wife handled the monster and trap turns for him and he just handled his character) so with a group of 13+ year olds it would have been much more manageable I think.,Its a fun game but it can get complicated.
Female,36,47.56,60,1951,PhD,EN,Web,3524,"With this set, I now own all three D&D adventure system products,  (WOA, Castle Ravenloft, Legend of Drizzt) as well as two Dungeon Command sets. I first bought Legend of Drizzt (easiest of the three) and found it to be a superb dungeon romp. Castle Ravenloft is brutal, a meatgrinder. WOA takes the middle ground, for the most part. There are times where something leads to multiple monsters spawning at one time. If you are playing two-player or solo, this will wear you down. One scenario calls for you to take out 12 monsters. Sounds simple, right? It would be simple, except that Ashardalon's card is in that deck, too. EVERY time we play this scenario, Ashardalon's card shows up late in the game, usually when the healing surges are already used up. Still, this game is quite a bit easier than Castle Ravenloft, tougher than Legend of Drizzt.

AS with all of these Adventure series boardgames, the miniatures are the cheapest RPG miniatures you will find. The dungeon floor tiles are nice and can also be used to generate random dungeons for tabletop AD&D. Also, the Dungeon Command game sets can be integrated into these adventure series games. Simply take the cards provided, shuffle them into your game monster deck. BAM! New monsters to torment you. (With painted miniatures) I take Two different Dungeon Command card sets, shuffle one of them into these games to add an extra flavor to the game. For example, shuffle Blood of Gruumsh into WOA to fight a lot of Orcs and their homies. The game will have a decidedly Orc-centric flavor. Shuffle Tyranny of Goblins into Legend of Drizzt, for a strong goblin aroma.

Buy any or all of these Adventure System games, they are simple, fast-playing, co-op (mostly) and above all, FUN!",WOA completes the trifecta

Female,70,48.38,55,1658,graduate,EN,Web,3547,"I own this and Castle Ravenloft, which are the two I would always put together. WoA is what most recommend as the one to get if you just get one -- it's difficulty is average (unlike CR which is cruel) and the heroes are good. These D&D games are so much fun because it truly is a ""system"" of sorts. You will end up having a ton of little figurines (sadly not painted the way some other games have them, but then again you get so many of it it only makes sense!), a bajillion little tokens, and an amazingly well illustrated rulebook, along with a really good collection of scenarios to play (a lot of 'em!).

This game, when you have the 1-2.5hrs needed for some of the scenarios with friends, just plays so well with the whole group. It's truly cooperative, every character is different and everyone can contribute into the fun.

I do suggest that if you buy this game, play it for a bit w/ the base rules, and if you ever start feeling like you are finding it ""a bit mechanically repetitive"" then pause, go to boardgamegeek and find the variants (one I published in fact) that allow for an ""Initiative"" system - it will change everything and you'll be back to enjoy this game in no time!

Male,26,49.2,52,1461,postgraduate,EN,Web,9875,"I would recommend this game to any fan of fantasy themed board games. I've always enjoyed the dungeons and dragons universe and this game is no exception. While it may seem daunting to some, keep in mind that the game contains outlines for different adventures with varying difficulty levels.

There are a lot of pieces but not all of them will be used for each adventure. Also, the rules can be flexible. Its kind of like landing on free parking in monopoly.  Depending on the house rules you may or may not get $500. Not everything is black and white where the rules are concerned. Let your imagination run wild. You can also use the pieces available to custom make you're own adventures. Or combine the other adventure system board games and dungeon command skirmish games to this and get even more creative. They all interconnect.

The miniature figurines are not prepainted so have some fun painting those as well. If you dig deep enough you can find user generated content online to add to your game. There are additional themed cards for monsters, heroes, encounters...etc. You can even find user created adventures.

Now if only I can find friends to play this game with. I'm only kidding. My wife enjoys playing and I've even played a few games over FaceTime with my brother and his family. That takes some extra preparation though. All in all this game has brought us hours of enjoyment with a lot more to come.",A very fun boardgame!
Female,45,49.2,47,1698,postgraduate,EN,Web,515,"Not really.  Been playing P&P RPGs since 1980, and this was a fun break while giving you the feel.  Immensely replayable.  Bought all three sets to eventually mix and match.",D&D Bored Game???
Female,29,49.2,50,1503,postgraduate,EN,Web,283,"I have a wife and kids & I don't have time to be apart of a gaming group, thus I really don't play D&D type games. I also live in a rural area where finding people to game with is difficult, especially for people who like something more than party games. Furthermore, I have been really tired of video games and wanted to play some board games as a break from all that.

I stopped playing D&D when I was a teenager, because some idiot would ultimately become the strongest player/character thus intimidating other players and then turning on everyone either killing them, or making them his slave during game play. I eventually quit because I was so unhappy with these confrontations. No matter who the group was, these negative effects seem to occur.

Recently I have been quite interested in the new D&D board games that have been produced by ""Wizards of the Coast"". After watching many reviews on youtube, I decided to take a leap and buy ""The Wrath of Ashardalon"". I like the idea there is no dungeon master and you could play this solo.

Box Opening/First Impressions:
My first impressions upon opening the box was that of a kid at Christmas, with lots of beautiful pieces. Dungeon tiles, to amazing artwork on the cards, very nice looking rule book, etc etc. The figures could be used for your regular D&D games and are high quality for plastic models.

All the components are sturdy and well made which should stand up over time.

Game Play:
I have played many scenarios and I would prefer a bit more narrative. They give you the overall game feel about a village needing help from a dragon and then there is a few sentences about the scenario you have chosen, but not much more.

However, I am a bit disappointed. ""TWoA"" seemed rather simplistic; draw a monster card, move, kill, deal with a ""encounter trap"", rinse and repeat. You don't really gain much XP, treasure or much for killing monsters, traps or any other deed. I have heard this game was BASED upon the 4th Ed. D&D rules. Much of the game play was simplified as well. I guess this is my concern and I have tried to remedy this with some alterations.

Playing games like World of Warcraft and Skyrim has made my idea of what a fantasy gaming should be? Because in many video games there is much more to do to keep you vested.

I know I can hear some people say, that there are other scenarios like ""rescuing villagers"", but really the different scenarios are much the same. I have heard you can use other pieces and elements from the other D&D board games.... but... I just wish there was more depth here.

I have been altering the game to make it more flavorful and interesting like making more Encounter cards. I have taken the 3 good cards in that deck and made more of them (treasure, healing potion). Thus making the characters deal with more than just being attacked at every corner. I also have bought real metal coins for treasure so the ""clinking"" sound of loot makes it more fun. I plan more altering in the future to keep the game fresh and fun.

In Summary:
As Tom Vasel (from the Dice Tower) said in one of his game reviews, ""people often don't like games due to their preconceived ideas they have or what they wish a game would be""... and I would generally agree with that. I do enjoy this game and I appreciate the quality of the game pieces and artwork. This game basically has made it possible for someone like me to run a D&D type game, even if I am a bit disappointed, I still enjoy this game. The price of the game is a bit steep for being so old. Still, the good replay value, the quality of the pieces made it a fairly good deal.

One quick side note: Check out Mage Knight board game (by WizKids), another fantasy game that is awesome and good for single players.","""Nooby-Part-Time-D&D-ers"" Game?"
Male,46,50.02,42,1548,graduate,EN,Web,2285,"I haven't played any type of Dungeons and Dragons games since I was a boy. With work and family duties it would be hard to find the time to play in a real D&D group, so I decide to do the next best thing and pick up this cooperative D&D board game, so I can play myself or with my family.  First off this is not close to the book version of D&D that I used to play years ago, it's a simplify board game version, your character can only level up to two, and go on short adventures.

The board game has many cards, tokens, figures and tiles.  So if you have small children you may want them somewhere else when playing because little hands like
getting into stuff. You get an easy to follow user hand book and an adventure book.

Gameplay can take over an hour plus, it all depends on how many players you have and what adventure you are playing.  This is pretty much a pure dungeon crawler so if you looking for something else like a storyline or true roleplaying this isn't the game for you. Many part of this dungeon crawler is random, like placing down the tiles and picking monster to fight, so difficulty depends on luck of the draw than anything else. Combat is very easy, just role a 20 sided dice and add any hit modifier to your role to hit, if the total is higher than the monster AC then you hit. You should be able to learn the rule after the first adventure. If you never played D&D games, this is a great place to start.

I would recommend around 3-4 players.",Simplify board game version of D&D.

Male,28,50.84,55,1673,PhD,EN,Web,2371,"Who am I:
Middle aged married guy who loves Sci fi, video games and fantasy novels. Used to play D&D and then AD&D around twenty years ago. Haven't been involved with any serious groups since then so I have no experience with any editions of D&D that cause such a rift in the community. This means that I am not hopelessly in love with any specific Edition of D&D.

-Note for various D&D Edition FanGirls and FanBoys- If you are a 4th Edition Hater and can't get past that, you most likely will not enjoy these games as they are based, in general, on the 4th Edition rule set. If you don't know what that statement means, or if you are capable of enjoying what each Edition has to offer, you should have no problems.

Why I love the D&D Adventure Systems:
Castle Ravenloft(CR), Wrath of Ashardalon(WoA) and Legend of Drizzt(LoD): They work as a stand alone product and offer a dungeon crawling, limited leveling, monster slaying experience with no previous knowledge of how D&D works. And all in sessions that can be finished in an hour or two. The minimal time commitment involved is fantastic.

Or, if you find yourself filled with nostalgia and desire a fuller, longer campaign with further leveling options or new characters, these games can be tweaked to allow for that. Especially with some of the user created content online, the photoshop templates on boardgamegeek.com in particular are wonderful. Also this [....]
address has a plethora of new content. The extra leveling options are definitely my favorite. The truth is that I screamed in happiness when I ran across them. I sounded like a ten year old girl getting a pony. A unicorn pony. with wings. A Unicorn Pegasus Pony that appeared in a shimmer of rainbow colors. And now I am deeply ashamed...........*sigh* I am such a nerd.

The game system totally allows for expandability in many ways. It's kind of a gateway drug for D&D honestly. I find myself consistently wanting just a bit more of the actual RPG experience. We tweak the game a bit and suddenly our experience is just a bit fuller and more satisfying. Not nearly as detailed and time intensive as an actual D&D or Pathfinder game though. Such a great balance for us.

They don't have to be expanded upon though, to be immensely enjoyable. Any of the three games are enough in and of themselves to be hugely gratifying and offer much re-playability. The expandability is just something that makes them extra cool and versatile in my opinion.

All three systems use totally interchangeable materials. Some of the cards may be context sensitive and not seem to fit in a particular environment but other than that you can use everything in each of the games. This provides Awesomeness Bonus of +2.

The map tiles and figurines both are an unbeatable value and can be easily incorporated into a ""real"" D&D session.
Everything in the box, other than the manuals, is of superb quality. The figurines alone would easily cost you double what you pay for the set here. And if you paint figurines, which I do, you will have just gained around forty new minis to paint. Joy in and of itself there.

Possible Cons:
I saw in the review for one of the three games that some dude was just totally disgusted with how these games ""punish"" the players for almost every activity they engage in. The guy was totally a Hater. However, he wasn't necessarily wrong. The game does seem to be constantly throwing things at you that often don't feel fair. Notably, the Encounter cards. Which brings me to the next con and a solution to the ""punishment"" issue....

The instruction manual will not answer every question that will come up. It is left up to the players to decide how certain things should work. Which is how a ""real"" D&D game works. Your group plays the game the way they want to play it. If you simply cannot function without every rule spelled out for you, this may be a problem. Otherwise you'll be fine. And in terms of rule tweaking and the punishment issue- we decided to change how often we draw encounter cards as well as a couple other minor aspects of the game. This has served to make our sessions a lot more fun. Don't be afraid to tweak the rules in order to play the game how you want to play it.

The manuals are pretty cheaply put together. They may not hold up well to use by younger players or spilled drinks. I took ours apart and put the pages in plastic binder inserts. We now have all the material for all the games in a single, sturdy, custom decorated notebook. Which is awesome btw. (Disclaimer for claim of awesomeness: I created the custom artwork:)

Space. With all the cards and map tiles and bags of monsters and tokens that get used in a typical session, you may find you need a bit more space than an average board game. All of the aforementioned items can quickly end up being a mess. As a solution we have everything securely contained in varying sizes of ziplock bags. Including the map tiles in a 1 Gallon size bag. Perfect for storage and during play.

There is no actual role playing or in town scenarios. If you want to get into a brawl over the serving wench's honor at The Yawning Portal Inn in the city of Waterdeep, then you should just find a gaming group and play Pathfinder or D&D(any Edition). Or perhaps, after stumbling into a gathering of Dirty Orcs in the Gloomy Forest of Gloom and Terror, you want to attempt to use an illusion to convince them you are a deity and sell them into slavery in the Land of Thay. As opposed to just killing them. Again, just go find a full-on game of D&D. These systems can be worked to allow for things like that to some degree, but they aren't designed to be open world or allow for anything other than a dungeon crawl with combat and a final, combat based, objective.

So:
If you want ""real"" D&D, then you may be more satisfied finding a group and getting involved.
If you want a game that allows you to engage in D20 based combat, with figurines, that represent a character with minimal leveling capacity. And that can be played by anyone. These systems may be just the thing for you.

Also of note: The Dungeon Command games have interchangeable map tiles, monster cards and figurines that can be used seamlessly with the Adventure Systems. I love this as it ads even more expansion options.",D&D Lite For Those With Limited Time
Male,49,50.84,56,2111,PhD,EN,Web,2387,"This is simpler form of D&D to be sure, and it isn't ever going to replace real AD&D adventuring, but as an introduction to role-playing, it is terrific.  My twin 9 year olds love it and have declared it their favourite game.  I like the way the random elements of dungeoun tiles, monsters, encounters, etc. make the same adventures replayable numerous times.

I can also see that when there are only 2 or 3 of you available for that regular D&D night and you can' play your normal adventure, you can still have a game of this in an hour or 2 with all the fun of spell combinations without the need to do any set up.  Just choose a character and an adventure and start playing.

Because of that it is probably a good introduction game if you are trying to get your friends into DnD in general. I like that there isn't interruption from rule searching although it does take a few games to get the flow of the game. I also love the versatility of so many different quest scenarios I haven't even done the Ashardalon adventure and feel satisfied.

Male,68,51.66,48,1601,diploma,EN,Web,5493,The components to the game are very durable thick card board stock. The miniatures are nice. However keep in mind this is not D&D this is a board game but it is very fun. Let's say your into D&D and you have a night where the DM isn't available. Why waste time setting up a new game with another DM that could take awhile? Just put this bad boy out and everyone should have a good time. I play it solo a lot as well which is just as fun too. I love it!,Great game if you like a D&D theme dungeon crawler board game look no further!
Male,67,51.66,52,1762,graduate,EN,Web,5510,"This game has grat mechanics. I think many get it expecting to have the kind of experience you have within the standard D&D RPG, but this IS a BOARD GAME! Albeit; the play is great, but there is just so much you can do with randomization. That's randomizing tiles, treasures, etc.

All these cards are not as awful as several people have said in negative comments. It uses actual 4th Edition D&D and it plays well for people who just want a casual night of gaming with family and/or friends. It's nothing extravagant but it will keep you in D&D without having to be a DM(Dungeon master). That is plus for me, since I have been a DM all of my life and never had others who could DM but once or twice.

So yea, if you love good boardgames that the family can enjoy or just to have a casual night of gaming, this is the game for you.

I would suggest watching Rodney Smith's ""Watch it Played"" series on this game which he has on Youtube.com You can see it taken out of the box, set up and played and make a more accurate decision on whether to buy it, it helped me a lot!

Female,38,52.48,42,1541,graduate,EN,Web,8235,"I just bought this game with my 8 year old son and we're completely happy with it.
I haven't played D&D since I was a kid and I really wanted to try a table top game with
my son. It's a big bonus that it's from the D&D guys.

My son was actually cheering and jumping up and down at time as we played. He was
definitely taken with this game. At one point he said ""This is better than video games!""
I agree.

It took us about 45 minutes to get the tiles popped out and read and understand the
instructions. I figured out most of the rules while my son geeked out over the cards and
figures.

Once we started, it was amazingly fun and the rules that we didn't quite understand at the
beginning became clear as we played. We actually played 2 games over 3 hours and can't
wait to play again tomorrow

The thing that's nice about the game is you can easily customize it to your tastes. It's a bit
like poker where you can play multiple variations on the similar sets and rules. I imagine that
the other two sets in the collection can be mixed and matched as well.

It comes with 13 adventures you can play from the adventure book or you can make your
own pretty easily.

Super fun and my 8 year old son took to it easily with only a little help. The guys at the store
I bought it from were saying it's too advanced for an 8 year old. They're crazy or don't know
any young kids. This is right up my son's alley.

I highly recommend this product!",Great game for Dad and Kids!
Male,18,52.48,46,1057,graduate,EN,Web,8275,"What this game is:  A rather simple, fast paced, dungeon based fantasy board game, that emphasizes team work.

What this game is not : A replacement for D&D Role Playing Games.

Like many of the adults who purchased Dungeon & Dragons Wrath of Ashardalon, I grew up playing fantasy board games such as Hero Quest, Dragon Strike, and Talisman.  I also played Dungeons and Dragons role playing game when I was younger.  Unfortunately, now my group of adult friends are not into role playing games so I picked up Wrath of Ashardalon with hopes that it'd be enjoyable to both experienced gamers and those who aren't.

Success.  Last night I played my first game with a group of my friends and we all had a very fun time, even though we lost.  This game is easy to learn, and fast paced so there aren't a lot of complex rules to have to remember.  One thing that we all enjoyed about this game is the fact that everyone works together as a team (as opposed to most board games) which I believe makes it an even better choice for children and younger gamers.  One thing to keep in mind however, is that the game can be difficult.  There are optional rules for making the game less challenging, which should be considered if you are playing with younger children.  For us adults, we still had fun even though we lost.  After losing we would discuss our ""tactics"" and how to do things better.  We would then generally setup the board and immediately try again.

As I said before the rules are pretty simple, but there are some situations where the rules might be unclear.  Usually we solved with with common sense, and deciding as a group what should happen.  But these situations were rare and didn't effect our gaming session in a negative way.

One thing to keep in mind however, that this is a board game... not a D&D role playing game.  So at the expense of depth and freedom of action, you have simple and easy to understand rules.  Perfect way to have fun with more casual gamers, children or those who are just getting into the D&D/RPG world.",Great board game for both casual and experienced gamers!
Female,17,53.3,48,1071,postgraduate,EN,Web,2849,"I recently bought Wrath of Ashardalon for my son's 10th birthday.  He's been wanting to play pen and paper RPG for a few years now and I thought this would be a nice entry way into that, it's not only that, it's much more.  The sheer volume of pieces that are required to play were are their own form of treasure.  The rules took a few hours of going over, but once we had it all figured it out the the games were going fast and furious.  He has to do his own math in determining if he ""hit"" a monster or not and I have noticed that this making him much quicker in calculating simple subtration in his head.  This is definitely a family game my wife and 12 year old play as well and we have a great time.  We are firm believers in the saying, ""the family that plays together, stays together"".  I am an old school pen and paper RPGr as well as computer and everything else in between, I love this game and always have a great time playing.  The designers have really created something unique and excellent here - I highly recommend to anyone that calls themseves a gamer and enjoys gaming no matter what the medium is!",Great Game for Kids of All Ages
Female,18,53.3,50,1167,graduate,EN,Web,2870,"I had high hopes for this game, as I am a big fan of Fourth Edition D&D (though if you like 3e, enjoy it! I'm not going to tell you one is better; I'll just tell you which one I prefer). I also enjoy games with modular tiles and such, so I really went into this game biased towards enjoying it.

Sadly, all that couldn't rescue this game. It is exceedingly repetitive. Play about 3 turns and you'll get the entire experience this game has to offer - there will be nothing new or exciting for you. The game is hopelessly shallow, based on so much chance that strategy is non-existent. Despite the modular tiles, the game offers virtually no customization.

The pieces seem to be well-made, and fortunately it might supply some use for actual D&D, since the store I bought it from doesn't do returns. However, the quality of the pieces is not matched by the game itself.

I really wanted to enjoy this game, so I played 5 whole games and an uncounted number of aborted attempts, before accepting the fact that it simply doesn't work. Extremely disappointing.",Disappointing
Female,65,53.3,43,1547,postgraduate,EN,Web,2874,"The short, short, version: Wrath of Ashardalon is exactly what it says on the box--a D&D boardgame. If that seems too obvious to be worth stating, read on.

Like probably millions of other aging geeks, I have fond memories of loooong nights at the game table with friends in high school and college, roleplaying until our eyes bled. But now I have a real job and a family and I'd be lucky to get a group together monthly for half an evening. So I was pretty excited when I saw Wrath of Ashardalon, because I was hoping that it would deliver the sugar high of a good dungeon crawl without the prep work or running time of the RPGs I used to play.

Now, in its defense, the game does pretty well. The bits are very nice, the rules are mostly clear, and the DM-less play works okay. It's not perfect. Occasionally you may run into situations you have to house-rule. I'm okay with that, but YMMV.

This game is sort of the epitome of Ameritrash (and I say this fondly, as someone contemplating buying a 3rd version of Risk): loads of theme, loads of violence, and loads--LOADS--of randomness. I realize that's part and parcel here, but it really sucks to work your way into a great (or at least survivable) tactical position and then watch your carefully hoarded powers and hit points disappear in a flurry of bad rolls (come to think of it, that sucks in Risk, too).

One thing I did not expect is that the game can drag on for hours. Except for a few special powers, no-one can kill more than one monster per turn, but you often get one monster per turn. Several of the encounter cards grow the dungeon for you whether you want them to or not, which keeps adding monsters. Then there are sentry monsters, which can open up new areas and thereby bring more monsters into the game. More than once we've had to retreat to a narrow hallway, bottleneck the ghastlies, and just pray we could mow 'em down before we got Walls of Magma. But if you're careful, and a bit lucky, you can just barely stay alive by clever use of powers, especially if you have the cleric and the paladin in play to keep healing folks. Again, part and parcel--""stay alive until you just barely win (or just barely lose)"" ought to be the definition of suspenseful, dungeon-crawly satisfaction. But in actual practice it feels more like, ""stay alive until the dice finally kill you (or fail to)"".

At which point you may think, ""why am I playing this instead of an actual RPG? I could use all the same bits, do all the same stuff, take just as much time, and have more options and more fun?""

So, in the end, that's what I did. This game drove me back to roleplaying games, first by tricking me into feeling like I was playing one for a while, and then by grossly running over its stated duration of play on more than one occasion. WoA is just what it says on the tin, a boardgame rather than a roleplaying game, and it is certainly cleverly done and has high production values. I like it. But I don't love it.",What it says on the tin
Female,49,53.3,59,2332,postgraduate,EN,Web,2877,"I play traditional D&D and have tried to teach friends how to play. Most of my efforts have been frustrated by the amount of time needed to prepare a proper character. This is D&D for the uninitiated. I taught several friends the rules in about 10 to 15 minutes. They had no idea they were learning the d20 system. The game is very similar to 4th ed. rules, but much more manageable.

The one-hour game also provides enough time to learn without being totally overwhelmed. The lack of a DM also serves as a nice bonus, especially for someone who ends up on the ""wrong"" side of the table from time to time.

This preserves the flavor of D&D much better than any video game and yet provides a good amount of accessibility. Plus, there are minis to paint.",Super fun
Female,50,54.94,43,1752,postgraduate,EN,Web,2457,"I've only played full D&D adventures a few times, and although I loved the concept, my main problem with D&D was the time investment and my noobish lack of understanding of the exact mechanics of the rules since I never had the opportunity to play with seasoned players.  Wrath of Ashardalon streamlines the entire process, simplifies the rules, and makes the game mechanics very clear.  Although I did need to look up a few rules clarifications on a couple of FAQs, it was easy to dive right in with a couple of friends and start playing immediately.

I can completely understand why veteran D&D players might be disappointed with this game, but I would propose that a veteran player could simply change the rules and add in whatever elements from the core D&D rulebook he or she wanted to use (including a DM) and simply treat this as a dungeon building/scenario pack with options for streamlining where desired.  That's my plan at least as I have a fun time using this game to ease myself into full-blown D&D at my own pace.

I'm more of a video game player, and to use an example from the video game world, take the classic game Civilization and its sequels.  You could play a full game that could take more than one day to finish, and sure it was a lot of fun.  However, Civilization Revolutions was later released as a streamlined, faster paced version of the classic, and I really enjoyed it as much as the original because sometimes I just didn't feel like committing many hours to a single game.  My impression is that Wrath of Ashardalon is to D&D as Civilization Revolutions is to Civilization.  One key difference of course is that you can adjust the amount of streamlining in Wrath of Ashardalon to make it as involved or not as a full-blown D&D adventure based on your personal preference.",fun game
Female,49,54.94,57,2322,graduate,EN,Web,2495,"Here is my review, cross-posted from boardgamegeek.com:

I have fond memories of D&D from my youth, that I occasionally attempt to recapture. I remember the sense of vague foreboding conjured by RPG-like board games such as Runequest and Spacehulk. I had read some favorable reviews of the new ""RPG-as-boardgame"" series promoted by Wizards on the Coast, and I was excited to try this. I splunked down my hard-earned cash and amazon duly delivered a hefty box of dreams to my doorstep.

Wrath of Ashardalon and I had some good times initially. My friends and I gamely punched all the cardboard pieces out of the sprues. We love punching pieces out of sprues! It inspires a sense of childlike wonder and anticipation in us! This tile has a Horrid Chamber on it! That dungeon tile has dead bodies! Ooh, I wonder what a flaming sphere does? These cards all have various powers and spells on them! Look, you can play a dragon character! And the plastic figurines were enjoyable, similar to those plastic dinosaurs we all had as kids. Whee!

Sadly, that was the best part of the game. Everything went downhill when we actually started to play.

The game itself is a reductionist vision of a dungeon crawl. It is, unfortunately, so reductionist that is effectively a game of Munchkin, but without a sense of humor. I think the game designers must have sensed this, and to try to add a sense of danger and urgency to the game, they created a deck of sadistic Encounter cards to punish us for playing. (But more about those later.)

The players progress through the dungeon together. At every unexplored edge, they ""kick down the door"" and grow the dungeon by one (1) new dungeon tile, guaranteed to contain exactly one (1) new monster, and possible an Encounter card (which is invariably unpleasant). This game might have been interesting if every new corner of the dungeon had produced a novel challenge for the players to make strategic decisions about together. Instead, the players typically have one power which is the min-max best option for any given monster, and they use it, over and over again. The twenty-sided die is rolled. The monster advances. It does a hit point of damage to the wizard! And then it dies. And drops a treasure.

It's difficult to be heroic in this game. The characters are punished for pushing forward into the darkness. They are also punished for standing still. They are punished for gathering together on one tile, and they are punished for spreading out. There are precious few strategic decisions to be made in this game.

All of this is incredibly tedious and dull. I magic missile the darkness.

The power cards feel poorly thought out, poorly worded, and disappointing. The ""Hypnosis"" card, seems promising: it can cause one monster to attack another! My goodness, a card that allows the players to turn the dungeon against itself! Strategy! But no. Unlike the Scroll of Monster Control item, which replaces a monster's attack on the players, Hypnosis simply supplements the monster's action with it's ""hypnotized"" attack. But can the power at least let the players turn the Cave Bear's awesome Claws attack against the Kobold horde? No, not really. The monster's attack is reduced to a standardized ""Attack +9, Damage 1,"" as printed on the card. Really, this card is a +9, 1 damage attack that only works if two monsters are in the same room. Is this what the game designers intended? Who knows! But hey, that's what it says on the card.

If the player's powers are boring, at least the game designers also gave us Encounter cards. We scrubbed through the rules multiple times, certain we were misinterpreting them. But no: every player will typically draw at least one encounter card every turn. Thus, a four-player band of characters fighting a monster will typically draw four encounter cards every round of combat. Sadly, the encounter cards aren't terribly creative. They all seem to be variants of ""Random thing happens! And everybody takes a point of damage."" Your band of fearless heroes has just spent a turn vanquishing a kobold, and you're feeling pretty good about it. But wait, you turn isn't over until you draw an Encounter card. Oops! The room you're in just turned into a pit! Most of the players fall into it. You do the heroic thing and stay in the room with the pit to help your friends climb out. But lo, on the next turn the pit rolls to attack again and sucks you in!

Many of the encounter traps seem more malevolent that is actually necessary. The spinning ball of blade trap will follow you from room to room. The walls turn to magma! But on the next turn the magma reverts to stone while an alarm sounds, alerting the orcish horde to our presence! A cage falls on your head! Poisonous gas fills the room! It's so zany! The Encounter cards prove to be far more lethal than any monster encountered in the dungeon. The players will come to dread having to take their turn.

We were certain that we missed some part of the game on our first run-through. Maybe we were playing it wrong. Maybe we had misinterpreted the rules. So we played it through a second time, and lo: the game as written is truly terrible. At least, we knew that with a few rule changes, we could fix this game. Instead of making the monsters and traps follow unrealistic instructions printed on cards, we decided it would be better to designate one of our number of administrate all the monsters. And, instead of using the limited characters provided with the game (and, no doubt, soon-to-be-available expansion packs), we would create our own characters ourselves. And, instead of plastic figurines and delightful cardboard squares, we would use our imaginations.

The game is much more fun that way.",a disappointing co-op game

Regardless...

Dungeons & Dragons: Wrath of Ashardalon Board Game (WoA) is a fantastic value at $65 (list). You get 42 (plastic, unpainted) minis (1"" scale), you get a nice set of cardboard interlocking(!) dungeon tiles, and you get a fun, very random, board game playable either by yourself or with up to 4 friends.

What it is:
WoA is, in gamer terms, a roguelike in tabletop form. In layman's terms, WoA is a dungeon crawler. You start at the entrance, and have a specific goal (rescue the villagers, survive the dungeon, destroy the altar, slay the dragon). The adventures are built randomly based on shuffling the tiles, and they are played individually as you explore. You can go for a massive linear dungeon based on a little luck and careful planning, or you can attempt to condense yourself in a larger swarm interconnected tunnels.

Some of the adventures feature ""chambers"", special larger rooms that are all placed at once and filled with enemies and a specific goal that the team must complete to win the adventure.

It's a great way to introduce someone into tabletop roleplaying gaming, it's the perfect medium between a board game and an actual pen and paper RPG.

It's a fun, quick* game to run a quick adventure for some friends taking anywhere between 20 minutes and an hour per adventure.

What it isn't:
A deeper roleplaying game with a full interconnected series of quests over a grand campaign.

A completely accurate representation of 4th edition Dungeons & Dragons rules.

Overly complicated (as most roleplaying games will seem to be for most people.)

What's in the box:
* 42 plastic heroes and monsters
* 13 sheets of interlocking cardstock dungeon tiles
* 200 encounter and treasure cards
* Rulebook
* Scenario book
* 20-sided die

Miniatures:
The game includes 42 minis, including 7 villan, 5 hero, and 30 monsters. The minis are of nice quality. They're clearly just mass produced, but they put some effort into modeling them, just not so much into trimming the leftover plastic in places. Some of the swords will be bent from being in the box. And they're unpainted. However, I don't mind the unpainted state, and I plan on using them during D&D Encounters I'm DMing at a local store. The Ashardalon figurine is very detailed, my *only* (and the only real) gripe is that none of them are painted.
4/5
Cardstock Dungeon Tiles:
They're one of the nicest parts of the set. They're very high quality, the art is nice, and the interlocking design can't be beat. Purchasers of D&D Dungeon Tiles will know how hard they are to keep together without tape, these lock together like puzzle pieces. Wouldn't be hard to use them in a real D&D game, except for the fact that they're somewhat limited, and they're not large open spaces. There are a lot of tokens and HP markers and other things all made out of the same cardstock (including cards for the Villans, your big bad guys, and the Heroes)
5/5
200 Encounter, Monster & Treasure cards
These are drawn during the different phases of the game (there are 3), and they certainly add to the randomness of the game. Everything scales nicely so that you can attempt to run the party adventures solo and it'll still work nicely.
5/5
Rulebook:
The rulebook is the only real downfall I've seen of the box set. It does an alright job at conveying the basics, but other questions I have are just non-existant. Can I spend a healing surge without being dead just to heal? The book itself has card errata on the back page, which is crazy. Other than that, it's not a bad rulebook for being only 15 pages.
3.5/5
Scenario Book (""Adventure Book"")
This has 13 adventures to run using the set, each of them varying based on how things shuffled, what magic items get drawn and if there's a chamber, what chamber card gets drawn. The adventures essentially play themselves as you follow the turn orders. There's very little fluff for each of the adventures, but that's what make it D&D, you get to set your own motivation for the adventure, your own background. It's enough to get you going, and you let your imagination take it from there.
4.5/5
20 sided die
AKA, the d20. THE iconic D&D symbol. You roll it, add a modifier and compare it to a set number. That's pretty much it. It's just as nice as the D&D Red Box dice or any chessex dice I've bought. But it's just a d20, nothing special. Nice if you don't have any, throw it in the bag with all your others.
5/5

Overall, I would have liked to see more adventures (that's not to say more aren't coming, the official ones available at time of review require Castle Ravenloft as well, which I don't have yet.) There's only one ""solo"" adventure, but I played through it and adventure 5 solo. Not sure if a single player could take on Ashardalon himself, but half the fun is seeing how well you can do.

I actually wouldn't mind running a full D&D campaign with similar designs; it's a perfect format for a Megadungeon delve, it's fast, and it's exciting due to the randomness. I'm glad the cards aren't collectable, there's 200, that's all there is.

All in all, if you're into RPGs, or if you've ever wondered if a Roguelike could work in a tabletop format, it can, and it's called Wrath of Ashardalon.

*Edit* I forgot to mention, the initial setup (punching out the cards) takes a considerable amount of time. Like close to 20 minutes. Setup per adventure doesn't take nearly as long (maybe 2-3 minutes)",Wrath of Ashardalon: great investment for an avid RPG fan who enjoys tabletop as well as CRPGs

Male,41,58.22,35,1463,graduate,EN,Web,10281,"As a long-time collector of Dungeon Tiles I can say without reservation that this is the best collection yet published.  True, most of the tiles are recycled from old sets (all of them as far as I can tell), but with such a low price, a full ten sheets of durable double-sided tiles, and the incredibly handsome and even useful box, the new Essentials line of Dungeon Tiles outshines every past edition.

What is this thing?:
Dungeon Tiles are handsomely detailed pre-printed heavy cardstock 'pieces' that you can use to cobble together a map for wargames.  In this case the tiles are sized for D&D miniatures (~25-30mm), with the grid spacing hovering around an inch.  The Dungeon Tiles sets include a whole pile of tiles representing rooms, corridors, furniture, traps, and the like.

The Tiles:
The Dungeon Tiles Master Set - The Dungeon contains a smrgsbord (a lot!) of tiles collected from previous editions, enough to build a respectable multi-room dungeon out of.  With a full ten sheets of double-sided tiles this is the biggest single collection published.

The Box:
In addition, the oversized box the tiles ship in provides superior protection to the tiles within, in addition to being a giant tile itself (the box is printed like a dungeon plinth and made from the same materials as the tiles themselves).  The box is easily big enough to store any loose tiles you might have collected from previous sets too, at least twice as thick as necessary for the product within.

The Value:
There has never been a better value in dungeon tiles published by Wizards of the Coast, between the number of tiles for your money, as well as the very handy box, this is a fantastic way for new DMs to build their collection of handy tiles.

Altogether this is a wonderful product for new DMs, or for those who wish to expand their collections.  If you already own several copies of every other Wizards produced Dungeon Tile you will not find anything new here beyond the box.",Putting the Tiles back in Dungeon Tiles
Male,38,58.22,95,3866,postgraduate,EN,Web,4470,"My 1st biggest disappointment with this box set is that it needed about double the number of sheets.  There's 10 sheets and they are double-sided, but most of the ""other"" side aren't very imaginative.  In fact, most of them are plain cement tiles.  There are some cool useful tiles, but only one of each.  Such as a bookshelf that's 2x4 but there's only 1 tile like this.  There should have been more doubles of these kind of tiles.  There's a web that's 2x2 but only 1 again.  Really disappointing.  There definitely should have been twice this many sheets.

So if you've got nothing else to decorate your mat this is a good start but if you've already got plenty of decorative tiles you should pass on this.",Good if you've got nothing else.
Male,58,58.22,11,463,postgraduate,EN,Web,4477,"This new compilation of tiles offers many items, which should find regular use in your gaming sessions.  Most generic tiles in this set offer few specific details, which is nice since they don't take away from your descriptions.

I like the idea of the packaging these tiles in the included reusable box.  Prior tile sets offer no storage for the included tiles once they are popped out of the package.  This box is sized to just slightly larger than the raw unpunched tile sheets.  There should be room to add in tiles from other sets with out issue.  The designers of the box included a generic tile pattern on the entire outside of the box, which can be used as a raised platform area.

I've purchased several of these and looked forward to including them into my game sessions.",Good for all DMs
Male,38,58.22,75,3052,graduate,EN,Web,4491,"First the good news. Dungeon Tiles Master Set - The Dungeon is nicely packaged. It comes in a box covered in dungeon tile graphics. It also reprints many tiles from out-of-print tile sets. With this one product, you should be able to create a variety of dungeons. The cardboard stock is good and the tiles can be easily separated.

Now onto the bad news. This tile set contains only 10 sheets. The box is large enough for twice that many sheets, so it has a cardboard insert. It's always disappointing when you open a package and half of it is empty space. Most of the tiles are reprints from previous sets. There are some new tiles, and some of the front/back combinations have changed, but the vast majority of tiles are reprints. More new tiles would have been nice for this new release. The graphics on the box is boring. It's the basic gray dungeon square over and over. And actual dungeon would have been cool. Somewhere a mention of this being Dungeon Tiles would have been nice. The box is of such a size that once you punch out the tiles, you cannot lay down the tiles without having gaps. If the box was just a little bit longer, you could have laid down enough tiles to fill the inside dimension. Why do I mention this? Without filling the box, tiles will move around and get banged around. I used previous sets to fill the box. You can stand on end the 2x2 and 2x4 tiles to fill the end gap. The lack of attention to detail is what I find disappointing.

So overall, I would only recommend this set to new DMs. If you have previous sets, skip this purchase.",Good for new DMs only

Female,32,72.16,86,4007,postgraduate,EN,Web,4415,"My boyfriend and I are big fans of the Dungeon Command games.  We now have all of the faction packs including this release, which is the newest.  It is definitely noteworthy that ALL of the miniatures included in this pack are completely NEW, not re-releases from the old D&D 3.5-era miniatures booster packs.  The previous Dungeon Command faction packs (Cormyr, Lolth, Goblins and Undead) all featured old miniatures, although many of those creatures have new color schemes.  To some tabletop RPG enthusiasts, the miniatures alone will be well worth buying this pack.  They are EXTREMELY well designed models with VERY nice paint.  We spent about 10 minutes marveling at the figures before we even thought about checking out their matching game cards.

Dungeon Command Veterans: The creatures/order cards from this pack add lots of fun new elements to gameplay and strategy and match well with any of the other faction packs.  In our first game, we pitted the Orcs of this set versus the Undead.  There seemed to be a very nice balance between the power of both factions, playing them right out of the box without customizing warbands.  Now that we have all of the faction packs, I think we'll probably start doing some customization.

If you are new to the Dungeon Command game, this is a very fun strategy board game / Trading card game hybrid where you essentially battle your army versus your opponents creatures until one warband proves victorious.  You draw cards in to your hand during your turn to bolster your creatures basic attacks/abilities.  The game takes about 2-3 minutes to set up, once you know how to play and a match can run anywhere from 30 minutes to 3 hours depending on how serious you get (kind of like chess.)  One of the best things about Dungeon Command is that you can easily put it away/set it back up if you need to take a break in the middle of a game.  My boyfriend and I usually play an entire match in two sittings during the weekdays.  If you are in to the D&D world and/or role-playing, you can definitely add as much RP and dialogue as you'd like.  If RPing isn't your thing, don't worry-- there's no dice rolling or paper and pencil requirement for Dungeon  Command, just lay out the board, draw your hand and you're ready to play!",Another great Dungeon Command set!

Female,43,103.32,28,2104,PhD,EN,Web,123,"Note that my review is identical for the three packs we own.

This is another pack for the Dungeon Command skirmish battle system.  For the most fun and balanced battles, you should have a minimum of two of the Dungeon Command packs.  Don't buy two of the same pack though, because half of the fun is making the most of your army with all of their different skills and special attacks.  The game is easy to setup.  This game is more about proper usage of cards than it is about lucky dice rolls.  That is a good thing.  The cards are beautiful and the prepainted miniatures are fantastic.  Fans of Wrath of Ashardalon, Legend of Drizzt, and Castle Ravenloft will recognize a few of the miniatures, as some of the molds have been ""recycled"" for this game.  My family has Lolth, Undeath, and Gruumsh, but usually only play one-on-one battles.  You can play up to four players, but you would need four, preferably different, Dungeon Command Packs.  As a bonus, the packs contain cards for each miniature, so that they can be used as monsters in Wrath of Ashardalon, Legend of Drizzt, or Castle Ravenloft.  I really appreciated that extra option for using the miniatures.

The Gruumsh command pack is Orc themed and includes the deadly ogre.  I always hate facing this beast on the battlefield, because he is extremely lethal when combined with Vorpal Blade card.  YIKES!  My son owns this pack and battle my undead warriors.  It's always a good match!  As long as I can do enough damage to the Ogre before my Dracolith is killed, I usually prevail.  However, if his Ogre sticks around too long, the undead tend to go to their second graves!

Female,29,37.72,51,1175,graduate,EN,Web,1577,"Three stars or five? Depends. This your first tile set?

First thing, for those who might've missed it -- check Lance's customer images in the upper-left corner of the product page to get a sense of what this box contains. I started to type in a list, only to find he's got it covered (and pictures beat a list any day).

3 stars: I've owned tile sets since forever, I buy a set or two each year maybe, and... I got this thing as a gift. It's okay, it's mediocre. Three stars. You won't find any tiles in it that really inspire you, and you won't find anything in it that lets you construct something inspiring. If you normally use a wet-erase-marker battle mat with inch grids, you'll probably find yourself pulling these tiles out only infrequently (it is nice to have gray bricks or green grass to walk on sometimes).

5 stars: You should buy it if you don't own tiles or a battle mat. Hands down. Five stars. Buy it immediately. (Oh, and if you don't own miniatures, also consider buying the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Monster-Vault/dp/0786956313/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Monster Vault</a>&nbsp;product just for the sheets of monster tokens.) I say this because, when first assembling a collection of design stuff, quantity makes up for quality. And this has quantity. In something like a decade of tile-buying, I think, I've never seen a decent mediocre-but-not-bad all-purpose starter pack for anywhere near this cheap. There's a fair amount of bulk here. You're getting about *twice* as many usable tiles for the price, compared to the apparently short-lived themed 4e tile sets. I pull these tiles out mostly when bulk constructing a room set, or putting together basic groundwork. If you don't have a plastic battle mat, this set is far cheaper than a single medium-quality battle mat, and you should be able to build all the rooms, hallways, etc. you want, unless you're building some huge labyrinth that will stay put together for multiple gameplay sessions. When you're starting out lots of big basic rooms and connective tiles for passages between the rooms and a handful of tiles for each common D&D setting are *exactly* what you need.

Why I'm going with 3 stars, rather than averaging 3 and 5 to get 4 stars: What the world really needs is a super-huge ""random variety of tons of interesting small odds and ends"" tile set. That would be incredibly valuable; even folks who print tiles off the Internet could use access to random inspiration. And while a few huge rooms and hallways printed from Internet pics can look decent and play well, 1x1 flimsy paper tiles just skid around on a map. I didn't expect this to be that ""tiny random curious things"" tile set, but they could've easily included a couple large sheets of 1x1 and 1x2 new interesting things lying around and charged $2 more.",Not interesting or inspiring. But maybe that's okay? It covers the basics

Unfortunately, there are never quite enough of just that one tile that I need a lot of, such as a room with 10 treasure chests (like a massive version of the money-making-game from Zelda). Understandably, one set can't possibly have all the tiles you need for every encounter, but this set does a decent job.

There are a lot of tiles in the set, of many different sizes.  Plenty of large ones and smaller ones that you can use to custom make your landscapes.  I cannot speak to whether or not these are different from other sets as I don't have any of the old ones, but if you don't own any wilderness tiles, these are worth the money.

SAVE THE PUNCHOUT BORDERS!  I have already started trimming some of these up to create walls, barriers, etc.  It's great to stick them down on top of the larger 8x8's when you want to segment a room.  A little blue sticky tack will hold it in place, and it gives the space the slightest of dimension, which helps your players immerse even more.

The quality is top-notch.  The tiles are two-sided, and each of the sets contains numerous add-ons that allow nearly endless varieties of terrain for encounters.

Since all of the tiles are done with symetric, equal squares for the grid, everyone of the sets is geomorphic.  You can use the wilderness set with the city set to create a park in a city.  You can use the dungeon set with the wilderness set to create a gothic, evil clearing.

The only limit is your imagination.

Male,56,44.28,51,1651,graduate,EN,Web,3478,"I have been a GM for some 20+ years and I remember when the very first tile set came out.  A friend of mine picked it up and we used it to plan out maps (before that it was a mat and a dry erase marker).

The one downside to the original tile set was how few tiles it gave you, and how it only gave you one blank dungeon floor tile.

When I heard they were making this set, I was a bit skeptical at first.  I didn't want to put down the money if it was going to just be a reprint of how the first ""dungeon tiles"" set was going to be.

You are given a lot of tiles in this set!  And, on one side of just about all the tiles is a blank dungeon floor!  That's right, nothing is on it!  Now, I can make a dungeon on the fly with these tiles and have the image on the tile actually be a feature of the room, but not everyone can do that.  So, if you want a featureless room, you can make that now with these tiles.

Yes, there are reprints from older sets, such as Arcane Towers and Halls of the Giant King.  But, even if you have those sets, this set is still worth it, for the extra tiles.  I am considering getting a second set so we can have enough tiles for our table.

The box the set comes in is rather durable and can carry the set easily.  Unlike previous sets which had no such feature, you could easily fit this tile set and another ""standard"" set.  It just makes it easier to transport your tiles to wherever you may game with your group.

Now for some bad news; they do give you a few black squares, which seems like a bit of a ""cop-out"" to me.  I could go and just get some black paper and cut squares if I wanted a black square or two.  Also, they give you two ""element"" tiles - both reprinted from Streets of Shadow.  Why you would need a whirlpool or a fire square that big is beyond me.  I personally would have like to have seen the altars from Fane of the Forgotten Gods reprinted, or some of the tiles from Arcane Corridors brought back.

I would still recommend picking up Arcane Towers as a complimentary set to this one.  With Arcane Towers, you can make a circular tower in addition to a dungeon.  Is it necessary?

Now set the top of the box up, right side up.  Now set this in the middle of your Chessex battle mat, add the summoning circles, the water, stairs up the center and a throne at the top.  Now put your minis in and attack the party with an extra helping of box text.  Like others, this is largely a reprint of tiles I owned some of.  Unlike others, I don't care.  The tiles wipe off with dry and wet erase, go back in the box for easy transportation and are mildly water proof so they can go on top when I'm transporting them from car to location if I'm moving.

Male,17,48.38,41,830,PhD,EN,Web,283,"Scoundrels of Skullport adds to the original Lords of Waterdeep in almost every conceivable way.  Both expansions included (Undermountain and Skullport) add quite a bit of new material to the game, namely new quests, intrigue cards, building cards, and the Corruption mechanic.  The new Lords, however, are pretty hit or miss to me, with most being boring and one being quite broken.  The ability to play either a long or traditional game adds a lot of depth as well, and the ability to integrate a 6th player is most welcome.

The new rules inset does a good job explaining how to integrate one or both of the included expansions, and also includes a pretty detailed errata which answers most questions that naturally come up during the course of the game.

I really wanted to emphasise how awesome Corruption truly is in this expansion.  It makes you feel dirty and well, corrupt, to pursue such unrestrained power in the context of the game.  It seemed that each game I played with the Skullport expansion was a sheer rush for all players to obtain as much Corruption (and other resources, too, of course) in the early game, and the later portions of the game everyone was definitely managing their corruption and trying to get rid of it (if possible).

This expansion is definitely enjoyable and it's difficult to even think of playing the base game without the expansion now.  Well done, WOTC.",Amazing addition to an already amazing game

Some of them are shoe-ins to win the game and others are almost impossible.  My husband and I are busy discussing the ways we can modify these new lords to make them more fair in game play.  I'm sure other people have been thinking the same.... But other than these new lords, the new game play is fun!","Great expansion, some bias exists"
Male,26,49.2,52,1461,postgraduate,EN,Web,2324,"Lords of Waterdeep was awesome, and Scoundrels of Skullport makes it even bigger, better, and crazier, like the original game on steroids. You get two expansions in one: Undermountain and Skullport. Both feature 3 new Lord cards, 3 new basic building locations (each on a separate small game board), a ton of new buyable buildings, plus a huge amount of new quest and intrigue cards. Skullport includes a Corruption mechanic that penalizes your end-game points by the number of Corruption tokens (blue skulls) you have vs. how many remain on the included Corruption Track (also on a small game board). You gain Corruption by using the awesome new buildings or completing some of the crazy new quests. Corruption is easy to gain but hard to get rid of (ask any politician, lol), but the game includes a number of ways to get rid of it a bit at a time (such as through using certain buildings, completing certain quests, or playing certain intrigue cards). Corruption management is vital. Don't worry about it early, but be sure to start cutting back by mid-game and reversing the number whenever possible.

This expansion also includes a 6th player faction, The Gray Hands, and an extra agent meeple for each color with optional rules to play a long game where everyone starts with an extra agent (you must use the long game rules when playing with 6 people). There are also caravan tokens which stand in for large numbers of adventurer cubes in case the supply runs short. In a 3-player game, this only happened once, but I can see it being necessary with 4-6 players because you will gain a lot more adventurer cubes a lot faster using either or both expansions.

Tried playing a 3p long game with both expansions, and it tripled the game time to almost four hours, but it (mostly) flew by. Part of the length was because we were learning the new rules and freaking out over the expansion's super-powered new stuff, partly chatting, and one of the players suffers from ""analysis paralysis"" big time, with the other two having milder cases. Pretty sure the game would have only doubled in length if we were less chatty and more familiar with the expansions.

Some of the new stuff seems like it might be underpowered or overpowered (and we don't like half the new Lords, including Xanathar who makes your Corruption penalty less, or Halaster Blackcloak and Sangalor who only score by buying their expansion's buildings and completing its quests, which get diluted when using both expansions). Compare those lords to the one who lets you score 6 pts. from any 1 quest type of your choice, or 5 for each 10+ pt. quest you complete). There are several ways to play 2-3 or even more intrigue cards per turn, and that really slows the game down and feels unfair and overpowered to the rest of the players. That said, both my opponents in the 3 player game I mentioned had the ability to play multiple intrigue cards per turn and I still beat them by hardly playing any intrigue cards. I focused on Corruption management, going from a high of 7 to only 1 at the end, which was only worth -4 pts. to me (instead of -28 pts), and solving as many double digit pt. Piety quests as I could (including a 40 pt. one) to get my Lord bonus of 6 pts. for any 1 quest type of my choice.

If you combine both Undermountain and Skullport in the same game, you have to remove 12 buildings, 30 quests, and 25 intrigue cards from the base game to accommodate all the expansion stuff. That'd be fine--once--but the rules want you to do it every time you play by randomizing which base set bits are removed. I'm not sure I can imagine only playing with one set after trying both, so maybe the best solution in this case is just to yank all the crappiest stuff out of the base set once and never use them again. Also, when the game is prepped for using both sets next time, neither the new storage tray or base set hold the combined buildings and cards properly, resulting in unsightly sprawl with loose cards floating around and a bunch of buildings having to be split between both boxes--which sucks.

Nitpicks aside, I do love this expansion, and you get a TON of stuff to freshen up the game that will keep you going for months. It's a great value and a lot of fun. It's so big and crazy, I'm not sure what the designers can do for the next expansion, but I'm looking forward to finding out!

UPDATE #1: Decided after another game using both expansions at the same time that it's just too swingy, too super-crazy, and unpredictable. And the Xanathar lord is broken and guaranteed to make you lose the game, so I've thrown that card out until it gets an official fix. Tried a game using only Undermountain, and that played much more like the regular game, only reasonably souped-up. Game time was increased to about 2 hours, nothing crazy like the 4 hours using both expansions. And I completed four 40 point quests! Will try using only the Skullport expansion next and update my review if necessary, but for right now, I'm advocating you restrain yourself from trying the mega-game and just do Undermountain first, then Skullport, then maybe try to combine them once just to see what that's like. But I think the expansions were not really meant or balanced to be used together.

UPDATE #2: After playing just the Skullport expansion, I have to say I'm not that fond of it or its Corruption mechanic. Undermountain is way more fun. Not that Skullport doesn't have good stuff, just that a lot of it is overshadowed by Corruption. I've decided to just streamline the base game and the expansions and weed out all the inferior or overpowered stuff (including anything that gives or removes Corruption), mixing just the cards and buildings that are the most fun. Some of these cards and buildings never get bought or played, so what's the point of bothering with them at all? Still others are possibly broken and OP, like the Yawning Portal (4 gold cost building that gives the user 2 cubes of their choice and the owner one and basically hands them the game if they get it early enough), or the Undermountain building (name escapes me) that lets you play three Intrigue cards. And all the new cards that let you steal people's buildings are unfair and create more hard feelings than fun. That still leaves a ton of good stuff to choose from. I'm knocking my rating down to four stars after having played with this set for about a month. It's not balanced well enough, and I hate that expansion games can take so much longer to play. The game isn't deep enough to support more than 60-90 minutes of play time.",Updated Review: Waterdeep on steroids!

Male,39,56.58,91,3634,graduate,EN,Web,4491,"If you love Lords of Waterdeep, you will probably love this expansion.  Lords of Waterdeep is easily in my top 5 favorite games.  The base game plays very well and I will happily play it once or twice a week and don't get tired of it.  In other words - you don't *need* this expansion to enjoy the base game.  (Which bodes well for the game, but not necessarily the expansion.)

So why did I get the expansion?  I mainly got this because I wanted to add in the option to play with a 6th player.  When my sister and her sons come over to play, we're sometimes in the 6 player range and it's unfortunate to make anyone sit out.  Scoundrels of Skullport adds a 6th player as well as two new modules to the game.  You are required (per the rules) to use at least one module any time you are playing with 6 players.  If you're playing with new players, this is easily done by using the Undermountain module.  It adds 3 new buildings to assign your agent to without adding a ton of extra complexity.  There are new buildings, Lord cards, quests, and intrigue cards - but you can simply tack on the extra board and forego all of those.  If you want to use the cards/buildings that come with Undermountain, there will be nothing unfamiliar.  It introduces no new complexities other than some quests which require a ton of ""resources"" for a huge payoff in VP.  This may seem overpowered - but the sheer fact that you're doing those quests means you'll be doing less overall quests.  It really does balance out just as well as the big 25 point quests balanced in the base game.

If you want to add complexity to your game, add the Skullport module.  It introduces a new resource - Corruption.  It, too, comes with new cards and a couple of new boards to sit beside the main board.  I haven't played with this one yet, but definitely think it will add fun dynamics for when we want a slightly heavier 2-3p game.  I won't introduce it to new players until they've played the base game a few times, but at that point I think it could work with 5-6p too.",Everything an expansion should be!

This expansion is actually two separate expansions (Skullport and Undermountain) boxed into one. It adds in a 6th player option for the core by adding in the Gray Hands faction (with all necessary wooden pieces) as well as additional wooden pieces for the other 5 factions that come in the core game to allow for up to six players. It includes the location boards for Skullport and Undermountain, as well as new Lord cards, quest cards, and intrigue cards for both of the expansions that can either be used with the core game individually or together. Included are rules to allow for a longer version of the game (essentially adding in an extra agent meeple at the start of the game). With the Skullport expansion there is also the introduction of the corruption track - a high reward but potentially high penalty system for obtaining resources in the game.

The expansion adds even more high stakes with not only the addition of the corruption track, but also the addition of 40 point quest cards, further solidifying for the core game that the winner is never really known until final scoring is had at the end of the 8th round. In our gaming sessions, we've had a player win by turning in two 40 point quests over the last two turns, and only winning by a few points.

The have only been two complaints from our gaming group in regards to this expansion. 1) there is a new lord in each expansion that scores by completing missions ONLY from that expansion, and the luck of the draw may not be in your favor when utilizing both expansions with the core set. 2) the physical box, by virtue of not having a big gaming board in it like the core game, will often have its pieces strewn about even with the plastic tray insert.

First off, Waterdeep was already a great game and didn't need an expansion, but Scoundrels of Skullport just adds so much more to an already great game.  SoS adds two new modules to the game that can be played independently or together.  Undermountain adds in some larger quests and new ways to get resources for those quests, while Skullport adds a new mechanic with corruption.  I really liked the corruption mechanic as it adds a new risk vs reward mechanic take too much and you're gonna regret it in the end, try to stay ""pure"" and you might not get the resources you need to win.

Male,27,63.14,12,443,postgraduate,EN,Web,11004,"Scoundrels of Skullport is a double expansion where one or both parts can be added to the base game to add more worker placement spots.  My group always plays w/ both.
Pros:
-New boards w/ more worker placement areas.
-New Lords, buildings, quests, etc.
-New twist w/ ""corruption"".

Cons:
-Set up and break down of the game is a chore.  For best balance, when playing w/ both expansions, some of the cards are removed from the game.  This means everything has to be sorted before the correct number of random cards can be removed.  You could get around this if you picked your least favorite of these to leave out permanently, but otherwise, these are supposed to be random.

Male,39,63.96,1,45,postgraduate,EN,Web,7042,"Using either expansion on their own is a nice addition to LoW but still leaves it feeling kind of light or not different enough from the base game. When combined they make Lords of Waterdeep a game that I constantly want to play, using both expansions adds a ton of table talk and expands the social feeling of the game while at the same time increasing the options and complexity of the game, in my eyes it is hard for a game to accomplish both of those at the same time and Scoundrels of Skullport is a fantastic expansion to the base game.

Read the full review here: [...]","When the expansions are combined, they make Lords of Waterdeep a game that I constantly want to play."
Female,32,63.96,78,3221,postgraduate,EN,Web,7101,"Lords of Waterdeep: Scoundrels of Skullport is an expansion for the original Lords of Waterdeep and requires the base set to play. The game was designed by Chris Dupuis, Peter Lee and Rodney Thompson and it expands the core experience to support up to 6 players.

Scoundrels of Skullport is actually two separate expansions in a set, as represented by two new locations added to the game. One is The Undermountain that includes new spots for your Agents to use and a good number of Quest cards and Intrigue cards that really up the ante. Undermountain is a realm that offers great riches for warriors who are brave enough to risk all. Then there's the titular Skullport, which offers new ways to gain power quite quickly but at the cost of corruption.

Skullport is the module that has the most obvious impact to the game given the introduction of the blue skull-shaped tokens called Corruption counters. Skullport-related effects tend to give you a lot of benefits (i.e. a spot that gives 2 adventures of any type) but at the cost of a Corruption token added to your tavern. Corruption counters count as penalty points at the end of the game and the more Corruption people give into, the more penalty points all players with such counters will have to deal with at the end of the game. Skullport-related locations. Quest Cards and Intrique Cards are designed to tempt you with great rewards in exchange for adding Corruption. And once the board is without Corruption counters, future Corruption penalties mean an instant 10 point deduction from that player's score.

Undermountain really shines in terms of the many quests that it adds into the mix of things with rather challenging requirements but also significant rewards. The quests include those that require a good number of adventurers but the card can also allow for players to use any types of adventurers to complete the quest. Of course there are additional requirements that trigger depending on the sorts of adventurers you send into the mix. And there are some card and building effects that allow you to seed the board with various rewards like adventurers or money in order to entire players to go to that spot.

What I really appreciate about Undermountain is the space it adds that allows a player to draw a quest from Cliffwatch Inn, then play an Intrigue Card. And we all know that Waterdeep Harbor used to have the virtual monopoly when it comes to playing Intrigue Cards. It's a tempting offer that allows one to further advance his goals, but without the benefit of the second action that players get from Waterdeep Harbor.

When you put the two sets together, it makes for a far more challenging Lords of Waterdeep game, especially when you max out the game at 6 players. Gameplay does get a little long at this point and it does require a bit of a commitment to see things through. But it's still not crazy long enough to consume your entire game night with just a single game.

I also liked how they tried to vary the sorts of Lord cards in the game. The original mix was mostly an effort to create every single possible combination of Quest Types per Lord apart from the ""builder"" as she's called in gaming circles. This time one can get points for completing quests of a particular expansion or even get a smaller penalty from corruption tokens in your tavern. Of course how things play out is a completely different story especially with cards that even allow you to reveal your Lord card early in exchange for protection from future Intrigue effects.

Lords of Waterdeep: Scoundrels of Skullport adds an interesting new set of rules to the core game that should keep things pretty interesting. Not everyone will want to play with both expansion modules at the same time, I expect, but the flexibility of the option certainly helps one tailor things.",Take your Lords of Waterdeep games to a new level.

It also comes with a bunch of new cards to play with as well (quest, buildings, and intrigue).  Some of my favorite quest and buildings are in this expansion pack.  The expansion rules tell you to take some of the old out, we don't, we just shuffle less.  Everything does not fit in the original box so we keep the game randomly split between the two boxes.  You can choose to only use one expansion board if you like, but then you'll need to sort out the cards that go with the expansion you are excluding.

I can honestly say this expansion makes my group of friends not want to play Lords of Waterdeep at all. Not only does it add significant length to the game, but it's just not very interesting, or game changing. I like that there are two different expansions in the box, and you can chose to play with one or both at any given time. I must admit, there are a few really awesome new Lords (which was much needed since Larissa Neathal was clearly overpowered in nearly every base game we'd play.) I think that perhaps there is a bit more added strategy in that in one of the expansions, there's tokens you take that can neg you points.

The only minor issue that we have with the entire system has to deal with inadequate scoring and building tokens.

This expansion expands the maximum number of players by one and also provides two actual expansions to the base game.  You can use one or both at the same time, however you prefer.  I recommend trying out each expansion separately before using them both at the same time, though.

Both expansions provide additional buildings upon which you can use your agents, most of which are good alternatives to buildings from the base game that tended to be in high demand.  They aren't exact duplicates, however, so there is some give and take as to which may be the best to make use of.  Overall, these lessen the impact that ""blocked buildings"" cause and lets you obtain some resources, especially in the early rounds, that might otherwise by more limited.

The second expansion, which we don't always use, also adds in a sort of ""sell your soul"" dynamic where the buildings provide resources as even greater rates than the base game buildings, but can potentially cost victory points at the end of game.

Both expansions provide new Lords, buildings, Intrigue and Quests cards, and additional agent tokens for not just the extra player, but each of the original colored player tokens.

Female,45,40.18,55,1623,diploma,EN,Web,3427,"LoW the base game has been the *most* popular and replayable board game. It's good enough to play /w 2 people or 5 people.

This expansion (which is really two expansions) makes EVERYTHING BETTER.

You get Skullport (new resource in the form of corruption/-points) and Undermountain (more intrigue, bigger quests) and new lords, intrigue, and buildings appropriate to the new mechanics. You also get a new color to add a new player.

We've primarily played Undermountain and it makes the game MUCH more forgiving when there's more players b/c it's harder to 'lock' a single player out of a key resource. My wife and mother in law don't like the idea of corruption (mom's a little religious/goody goody) so we haven't played it much, but based on reading through the buildings, cards, etc., it adds a lot more volatility to determining who wins in the end.

There's extra agents to play a 'long game' variant, which is nice (broke 200 points once o. O).

Some folks have mentioned issues with the first run (which I think i have). The quest cards are printed 'upside down' compared to the base game. Makes it easier to sort for us afterwards b/c we just sort based on orientation of the back of the card. There are icons on everything so you can easily see which expansion it belongs to.

There's a game mode that lets you play with both expansions, but then you remove cards and buildings from the original expansion, which can give you a lot of different synergies/combos compared to just playing with one expansion.

There are some really cool synergies/combos around certain quests, intrigue cards, and buildings. For example, mom completed a quest that allowed her to draw an intrigue card after she plays one and then there's another building that allows you to play multiple intrigue cards (I think 3) and another quest? I think that gives you victory points for intrigue cards. She literally couldn't use all the intrigue cards she accumulated, but it was pretty fun and cool since we had to change our strategy to try to prevent her from playing intrigue cards.

Finally, there's a intrigue card that allows you to 'steal' resources from an opponent, but then that player gets the intrigue card (so they can 'attack' you back later). The flavor text is: Cue Evil Laugh. So we made mom do an evil laugh everytime she used it, which is hilarious in and of itself.",Oh so absolutely worth it

We have played four games with the expansion since Christmas, and we are pleased. The addition of the Corruption rules with one of the expansion boards is very well thought out and adds an additional level of strategy.

The components are high quality, just like in the original set. As an added bonus, the expansion fits into the original box.

Each expansion card has a tiny little icon that is hard enough to notice as it is, but combine that with a deck where the cards are facing every which way because the upside-down expansion cards make it impossible to maintain any sort of order, and separating the cards gets really annoying.

The pictures to be matched consist of various Cat trucks and diggers, as well as construction signs and equipment/tools used during heavy construction.

The Cat trucks and heavy equipment drawings may be somewhat confusing for those not specifically interested in construction machinery.  However, that was not the case for my grandson who is fascinated by machinery and heavy equipment.  He was thrilled with this matching game and regularly beats the adults in our family who are not as conversant with the subtle differences between various machines.  The particular trucks, diggers, signs or construction tools name is printed on each card of the pair.  The backs of the cards are printed in a black and yellow diagonal stripe design that makes remembering the locations of already revealed items even more difficult.  If you do not concentrate on remembering the position of previously revealed cards, the diagonal-stripe pattern can be even more distracting.

Most matching games feature a maximum of 48 cards (24 matches).  Those cards are flimsy and are not likely to survive childrens enthustic play.  Big Trucks and Diggers Matching Game features 72 cards (36 matches); these cards are made of heavy card stock that is approximately 1/16 thick.  The number of matches you choose to use when playing this game can vary depending on the childs age and memory skills.  The box is also very sturdy; it closes using a magnetic flap rather than being a conventional two-piece unit.  Plastic dividers keep the cards organized inside the box.  I appreciate these details since they can add to the games durability.

I also have him find certain tiles like where is the hard hat. This game is great for expanding their vocabulary! We talk about what each tile is and he repeats what it is.

Female,32,82.82,24,1283,graduate,EN,Web,4390,"The One Ring is a very innovative RPG set in Middle Earth between the time of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings.

In order to play it you need occasional reference to die rolls. Specifically, you need a 12 sided die (Called a D12 by the cognoscenti) and up to six regular six sided dice (D6). The game comes with one set, but you will likely need more.

That's what you get in this boxed set: One D12 Feat Die, six D6, all in a black/dark gray on off-white color scheme. I asked about different colors when I bought my set and was told that there are no alternatives to this one. Oh well.

Why can't you use ""ordinary"" dice of that type? You can. You'll need a crib sheet to make the D12 into a proper ""Feat Die"" but other than that you are good to go.

Why bother with these expensive dice then? Well, the D12 Feat Die is properly marked up with opposed faces for the Eye and Gandalf runes for one. That matters to some people. If you use some D12 you have lying around you'll be using the ""11"" and ""12"" faces for those special results and they aren't going to be on opposed faces of the die. Big furry deal, right? But of course, everyone had better be using the *same* faces for those runes if there isn't going to be an almighty real-world fight at some point. The real die avoids this issue.

Also, the D6s are marked up so you can quickly tell the ""1"",""2"" and ""3"" faces from the ""4"",""5"" and ""6"" faces which makes evaluating successes very quick indeed. Not only that, the ""6"" face has a special meaning sometimes and it is elaborated upon with even more detail making for unambiguous and easy recognition of that event, should it occur.

None of these are show-stoppers for using non-specialized dice, but consider: if you introduce a lot of new players to a One Ring game, how much easier is it to explain the mechanics of the die conventions if you are using this set? A convention GM would consider these money well spent I think. I do.

Besides, you should use the right dice for the job or you will annoy and vex the Dice Gods. Nothing good comes of such reckless behavior.",Special Dice for a Great Game

It can make a big difference if you play a bunch of them near the end of the game when everyone is tied up fighting for 1 or 2 point lands and you drop and take over a couple of 7 pointers in the last round.

This can be a very cut throat type of game if you play with some aggressive players.  Always get as many players as you can, more players makes a much more interesting game.  Also remember that fates can change at the drop of a hat.  Being achingly close to a victory then having it snatched away by the next player can be frustrating, but then you can do it back to him on your next turn.

Female,38,92.66,8,518,PhD,EN,Web,8933,"Colorful and full of a simulated adventure, Doctor Who - The Card Game, released by TreeFrog Games and Cubicle 7, is an original design by U.K. game designer Martin Wallace who has been designing games since 2001. Here is a card game that uses cards, Dalek tokens and TARDIS tokens to defend or attack your lands for ownership.

The colorful cards each have very a specific meaning and purpose. The defenders who are The Doctor, Amy, Rory, River Song and even Captain Jack fight for keeping land that you lay down as your property. What land? Imagine every place the Doctor has visited since his run as the 9th through the 11th Doctor (Christopher Eccleston, David Tennant, Matt Smith). Lake Silencio, Sardick Town, Silurian City, Bowie Base One, Roman Britain, Luna University and Zarathustra are some of the locations to name a few.

Now the Enemies include the Daleks, Nestine Consciousness, Cybermen, Weeping Angels, Sycorax, Sontarans, The Silence, Davros, the Minotaur, the Beast, Gangers, The Master, Prisoner Zero, the Slitheen and more who all try to take your lands. Oh and watch out for the Dreamlord! He's really dangerous!

Now add the element of support cards to help you fight, defend and in some cases give you special powers and abilities. They are labeled the TARDIS, Sonic Screwdriver, Fish Fingers and Custard and yes they do help immensely!

Cards are dealt out. Then you figure out your lands. Then you place your defenders or attackers and the battle begins. The game is played in turns and what is unique is that you play your hand but you always must have three cards to pass to your player on your right. (Counter-clockwise) The turn continues going to the next person on your left. (Clockwise) In other words you are doing things in two directions. Sounds strange, but it makes for great stagey in playing.

Once you achieved a land, you then place your colors TARDIS token on it. If you are attacking or taking over someone else's land that is not yours, you place your colors Dalek token on it. When the first player gets five TARDIS's or five DALEK's out on table in their color, the game is over and everything stops. However, your lands are worth victory points. Some are low and some are high. The victor is the one with highs points from the lands they have acquired.

It can be vicious and turn on a dime. You could have four lands in one turn and zero the next. It changes with the player and the cards. It's extremely fun and you find yourself acting out scenes from the various enemies and locations you see in your hand. (If you are familiar with Who, of course.)

Its fun for the whole family and you can sit and relax and bring on your `game face' when you are to defend the universe using the Doctor and his companions for help. But beware, enemies abound and trouble is always both in front of you and behind you! Look for it on Amazon.

Male,40,92.66,91,6005,PhD,EN,Web,8962,"I primarily bought this game to generate Hazards for the the One Ring roleplaying game. I'll start with the positives: The card stock is large, thick and gorgeous to look at. The game itself seems like it would be immensely fun for anyone who's even remotely extroverted.

The way this game can generate Hazards for the aspiring Loremaster is primarily by drawing cards and then matching up colored shapes on the card to a chart. They are fun, thematic and give hints while leaving it up to LM what happens. Now I don't think I am colorblind, nor have I ever had trouble with any other games, but I absolutely struggle to tell the difference between these colored shapes on the cards or on the chart. The creators seem to have chosen purple, purple with Elven triangle, and slightly lighter purple with Elven square. I suspect I, and you, will be able to get around it by getting used to it, I just wish C7 had gone with more traditional ROYGBIV.

My crappy eyes aside, I recommend this game for playing with friends or a supplement to your tabletop.

Male,38,39.36,59,1623,postgraduate,EN,Web,9150,"As a dad of two boys Im always on the lookout for activities for us to do together.  Something we can all enjoy and equally get into.  We built a Da Vinci catapult, a siege tower, did some exploring with microscopes, geocaching, etc. with varying degrees of interest in one of the two boys.  Dont get me wrong we all had fun, but it was more for one or the other depending on the activity.  My older son, since the day he could, has loved to talk.  He loves to tell stories about things hes done, things hed like to do, or things hes watched.  If he can make a story out of something, he will.  My younger son has, since I can remember, loved to play board games.  There are ones he likes more than others but I don't think weve played a game he didn't like.

I recently became aware of a card/board game by a company out of the UK named Cubicle7.  The game is called Hobbit Tales: From the Green Dragon Inn and it looked very interesting.  Cubicle7 also makes a RPG that takes place in the same world as this game called The One Ring.  The cards in this game can be used with that RPG if desired, so its all very integrated.  The basic premise of the game is that the players are hobbits sitting around a table at the Green Dragon Inn telling stories of their adventures.  The game takes place in rounds (one for each player) and they tell the story with the aid of Adventure Cards (75 of those).  Each adventure card has a story aid, something to inspire the story teller, a title and a Tolkien quote, along with some excellent artwork to really inspire you.  However the other players have similar cards called Hazard Cards (40 of those) that they use to try to throw the story off.  Things like a goblin patrol, or a group of brigands.

This is the real magic of the game, when the players interact with each other in the telling of their (or each others) story.  The goal of course is to score the most points of course but the fun isn't in winning or losing the game at large.  We always count up the points and figure out who won, but thats just sort of a whatever moment.  We really enjoy the interaction and getting to tell a well flowing complete story and the opportunity to interject into others stories to tell a bit of the narrative ourselves.

Of course there are rules that govern when you can play a hazard card, and how you decide if the hazard card was effective, but the rules are so simple it really took no more than a few minutes to get a full mastery of the games rules.  Thats a neat feat all of its own.  Most board games require much more attention to the rules.  Dont I get to shouldnt he  type of questions that make you go back to the rule book and figure out how it works again.  Not so with this.  I haven't opened the rules book since the first read through.

So this game fits both of my boys perfectly.  I cant imagine them liking a game more.  Its a board game and the way you play is by telling stories.  Its almost as if the game was created specifically for my family (Im a LOTR nerd, I admit it).  Ive only had the game for 3 days now and already weve played it probably 10 times or more.  No matter how many times we play it its always different (due to the number of cards there are almost unlimited possibilities).  I imagine well be playing again tonight after dinner.
Oh, and I didn't really get into the artwork on the cards.  It is fantastic.  Some painted; some more like pen and ink drawings.  All of which feels very much like what youd expect in a Tolkien inspired game.  I believe some of it is used in the illustrations in the One Ring manuals as well (the art direction of the game has the same feel even if the game is not the same type of game.

Ive been very impressed by the selections Ive seen from Cubicle7 so far.  Im going to have to look into more of their products rather than just the ones in my wheel house (again, Tolkien nerd here).  But do yourself a favor and find this game and buy it.","Hobbits love telling tales, so do I"

Female,32,41,56,1482,postgraduate,EN,Web,1497,"Doctor Who: The Card Game was created by Martin Wallace and is published by Cubicle 7 Entertainment. The first edition of this game focused more on the adventures of the Eleventh Doctor while the second edition that we purchased covers the Ninth, Tenth and Eleventh incarnations of the Doctor. The game supports 3-4 players.

The game has players play the role of the Doctor and his Companions as they try and defend the Earth from a whole range of alien adversaries as seen on the show. All players start with a location card, that represents a place that is in need of defending and each location has a declared point value that will come into play at the end of the game.

Players will have a mix of good and bad cards that can be used to defend your locations or to attack other locations. So while you are focused on playing more valuable locations and seeding them with defense cards, you also have a chance to put rival locations under threat, so in this respect players are also playing the roles of the various adversaries of the Doctor. And this is one of those quirks of the system that weirds me out.

Whenever an Attack card is met with a Defend card (which is played face down initially), players then start comparing the numerical values written on the cards to determine who wins the battle. If the Attacker has a higher value, then he gains control of the location until the player can retake it. If the Defender wins, the attacking card is discarded, but in general so is one of the defense cards. This also gets you a Defended token for the location, which counts towards victory. So you can see you'll constantly need to play defense cards in order to maintain your defenses against other players.

The biggest innovation of the system is the fact that cards sort of go back in time since at the end of your turn you need to be able to pass 3 cards to the player whose turn precedes yours. On average you'll have 5 or more cards in hand during your turn so you'll only really get to play two of them unless you spent your time points to draw additional cards. Tie points are earned through locations and other card effects and are generally used to draw more cards during your turn. The passing of cards does allow you a limited degree of strategy as you'll have some idea what cards that player will have once his turn comes around. But the fact that this process goes backwards in terms of play order makes the potential benefit of this ""knowledge"" a little limited.

The game's main redeeming value lies in the cards themselves since they feature various notable characters from the series. The second edition is especially squee-worthy since it involves most of the show's recent history since 2005 save for the more recent developments with the Twelfth Doctor. And the various abilities attached to these cards generally fit well with the characters, which does help make things more fun.

It's really the whole PVP aspect of the game that makes things feel a little weird since you are both defending Earth as the Doctor but also attacking it as the aliens. And why this was the final mechanic for the game confuses me a little since you'd think that they could have figured out a way to balance things out better. Plus the fact that the game requires a minimum of 3 players because of the card-passing mechanic does somewhat limit how easy it is to get a game set up.

Doctor Who: The Card Game is not a bad game, but it's also not quite as fantastic as all of us Whovians hoped it to be. You'll still have fun with it though, at least among your fellow Doctor Who loving friends.","Fun card mechanic, quirky internal logic."

Simple statement of fact-I don't know Michael Thal, but I do now know more about deafness and how folks with hearing loss get through a day. I ached for David as he faced new school situations, signing, the aching loss of his music, and growing up in an entirely different way than he'd ever imagined. But, central to my experience as a writer for kids of all ages was how universal Thal made his character's experience. David is deaf, but he's so relatable as we all remember the terror of starting a new school, the pain of losing a friend, the sweetness of a first love, and the `oops' things we all do growing up. How do any of us survive? We do it like David, just by hanging in there, being willing to try something different, and listening even when you can't hear.

Female,26,17.22,66,649,graduate,EN,Web,518,"An inspirational story well told.  The story of a teen born with a natural gift, losing that gift, and finding the strength to overcome his loss and live life to the fullest.

When twelve year-old budding violin virtuoso David Rothman wakens from sleep the day after his birthday celebration, he is greeted with a devastating gift.  David cannot hear a thing.  He is deaf. How ironic.
Goodbye Tchaikovsky is the story of Davids journey from the depths of self pity and despair to the height of embracing life.  The story follows David through his teenage years as he turns from his passion, the violin and struggles to cope with his hearing loss while encountering the tremendous pressures all teenagers face. Will David triumph?  Will David grow and embrace life or will he fail?

This story is especially meaningful for all teenagers, who are beginning to face lifes challenges at the same time that they are adjusting to peer pressures and their self images.  I highly recommend this book by Michael Thal, himself a hearing impaired retired teacher.  Michael, who lost his hearing later in life, has firsthand knowledge of his protagonists handicap and struggles.",A Teenager Survives A Great Loss
Female,49,18.86,29,406,graduate,EN,Web,2521,"On David Rothmans 12th birthday he was a virtuoso violinist with the California Youth Symphony. His future in music was already mapped out ahead of him, from special schools for gifted musicians to one day playing solo at Symphony Hall. The day after his birthday his world came crashing down around him. A hereditary condition had robbed him of his hearing. Overnight David went from perfect pitch to deafening silence. He was devastated by a grief that nearly destroyed him.

Goodbye Tchaikovsky"" is a coming of age story with a twist. As David deals with the normal struggles of growing up, his profound hearing loss forces him to begin his life all over again. He feels like he doesn't fit in the hearing world because he's deaf and he doesn't fit in the deaf world because he can speak. By learning American Sign Language (ASL) he finds a way to cope and gradually his two worlds come together. But he still must face the hardest question of all. What will he do with the rest of his life?

As someone who is hearing impaired, I feel Good-Bye Tchaikovsky is an authentic portrayal of the challenges involved with sudden hearing loss. In telling David's story, Michael Thal has created a survival guide for young people who are hearing impaired.",A survival guide for young people who are hearing impaired
Female,29,18.86,98,1129,postgraduate,EN,Web,930,"Michael Thal has written a beautiful novel. It's a must read for middle schoolers and up. Goodbye Tchaikovskytells the remarkable, eye- opening journey of David Rothman, a boy who suffers permanent hearing loss at the tender age of twelve. Thal's way of showing both hearing and deaf worlds is amazing and how they affect someone going through this tragedy. David Rothman struggles to accept he can no longer pursue his passion--music, and worries how he will fit in when neither deaf nor hearing people totally accept him. His future, his dignity, his sense of purpose hangs by a thread. But David has the help of a family member and friend to push him through the first difficult years, to assimilate into school and the throes of relationships. The reader travels from David's early adolescence all the way to graduation and the beginnings of college, and they get to rejoice in his journey, stumbles and all. Goodbye Tchaikovsky is a quick read with believable characters and snippets of other cultures--Judaism, Japanese families, and the culture of the Deaf world. When reading this book, it really opened my eyes to the feelings and thoughts going on inside the mind of someone who is deaf, fighting to be recognized in a hearing world. Excellent job, Michael Thal!",YA booklover
Female,29,19.68,35,421,graduate,EN,Web,399,"It's not often that a book aimed at ""Young Adults"" makes me want to cry. Michael Thal managed this with his story of David, a violin virtuoso who suddenly went profoundly deaf the day after his twelfth birthday.

Goodbye Tchaikovsky is excellent on many levels.

First, obviously, it is an introduction to what it is like to be deaf in a hearing world, presented so the young reader identifies with Davids experiences on an emotional level.

Second, it is a primer on empathy. ""What if that happened to me?"" Michael's choice of hero is perfect. The underlying message is, ""What if I lost the ability to do the activity that gives me meaning in life, joy and purpose?"" A teenager with a passion for basketball might imagine what it would be like after breaking his neck, another who lives for computer games may think of blindness or a paralyzed hand...

Third, Michael deals with the issue of stigma and discrimination, showing that, whether you are Christian or Jewish, ethically Japanese or Caucasian, deaf or hearing, you deserve respect, compassion, decency, and love.

If you, or someone you care for, are struck by a handicap such as deafness, you can draw instruction and inspiration from this book. However, any teenager will enjoy reading about David's journey, and benefit from the underlying lessons within Goodbye Tchaikovsky.",I'd buy this book for any teenager
Female,33,19.68,73,942,graduate,EN,Web,504,"First of all, I want to note this book is probably one of the most powerful stories for tween and teen boys I've ever read.

David Rothman loses his hearing at the age of twelve to a hereditary problem he knew nothing about. There is no warning, no gradual loss. One day, David is rejoicing after a virtuoso solo performance at Symphony Hall in New York. His performance receives rave reviews, and he's excited about a future performance for the Queen of England in London. David returns home to celebrate his twelfth birthday, and the next morning he wakes up deaf.

Michael Thal brings us this story of personal triumph giving way to disaster into the forefront. His character, David, lives and breathes the violin. He is a hardworking prodigy, but now his world is forever silent. The reader experiences David's loss as he does. We walk the sad path where he stumbles, but he picks himself up with assistance from unexpected sources. Sometimes, adults show David the way, but as he slowly accepts his disability and makes his own decisions about his future, he finds himself on a path far different from what he once envisioned.

Adversity is something people face daily. Thal weaves a tale of overcoming an overwhelming and terrifying situation with grace and humor. I recommend this book not only for tween and teen boys, but also for their parents, grandparents, and families. David's courage as he straddles the hearing and deaf worlds shines throughout the story.

On a personal note, I connected with this story from the parallels in my own life. My teenage son had an accident in middle school, where he punctured an ear drum. He plays the saxophone  alto, tenor, and is currently learning the baritone. We held our breath until he healed, but I could see myself in the place of David and his mother easily. Thank you, Michael Thal, for this moving tale of overcoming a major obstacle.",Wonderful telling of a heart wrenching tale
Female,49,20.5,5,76,diploma,EN,Web,948,"I love these flashcards. They have very realistic, colourful pictures on them. There is a word that accompanies each picture both next to the picture and on the backside. The cards covers a wide range of topics such as body parts, places, objects, clothes, animals, and colours.
I started using these cards with her at 3 months old. Even then she was captivated by the pictures and listening to me go though them. At 16 months she is now seeking out her flashcards and can point or show me which body part the card is describing. She has started associating the picture on the flashcard with things in her environment. I can tell the cards have turned into something she really enjoys doing on her own.
My only regret is that I didn't laminate the cards when I first purchased them. I will be purchasing them again and laminating them. I see these cards being something we use for years to come.

Male,19,27.88,73,929,graduate,EN,Web,3525,"I received my Ball of Whacks about a week ago and have trouble putting it (ok, them) down.  Interacting and playing with it is extremely addictive and I have hooked my boss and another coworker by giving them each one.

When I was younger I made crystal models out of marbles and geodesic domes out of cardboard and remember the excitement of uncovering different relationships between the shapes.  The Ball of Whacks is bringing back that feeling of exploration and discovery and has quite a few patterns built into those 30 pieces.  I forgot how much fun I had doing those explorations as a kid and can't figure out why I ever stopped.  The Ball of Whacks includes the symmetries of all five platonic solids if you play with it long enough.

I would suggest getting a couple of them - at least one for your desk and one for playing at home.  You may need extras to share with family and colleagues and they are fun to combine into larger constructions as well.

In creative problem solving sessions with coworkers I like to bring in various toys both to stimulate their playfulness and to change their environment a bit.  I am looking forward to trying out the BoWs in my next session although I am a bit worried that I might not get them back readily.

Awesomely fun and gets the brain juices flowing too!!!",Geometric Hand Candy
Female,41,30.34,26,566,postgraduate,EN,Web,3547,"If you only employ one creativity-enhancing resource for the rest of your life, make that resource the Ball of Whacks!

Breakthroughs in effective creativity-inspiring methods seldom occur.  Most ""new"" methods are simply restatements or reshapings of ideas that flourished among the ancient Greeks (such as Heraclitus, a favorite source for Mr. von Oech) or before.  Those who are familiar with the earlier work usually don't gain much from the newer approaches.  The Ball of Whacks is a happy exception.  Heraclitus would say that you can never interact with the Ball of Whacks twice in the same way.  And he would be right.

The most valuable creativity-enhancing methods I've experienced usually require having a team work together, with one of the tasks involving making little models or prototypes of creative concepts.  I often find myself wishing I could have those experiences more often . . . but seldom having the right people and time to pursue that desire.

Then, I discovered Roger von Oech's Ball of Whacks. Wow!

My frustrations are now behind me.

This is day 8 of working with the Ball of Whacks.  It's been quite an education.  I can hardly wait to find out what I'll learn on day 9!

When you first see the Ball of Whacks, you won't quite know what to make of it.  Open the box, take out the ball, the magnetic stand and the workbook.

Then, let yourself go.  Discover what the ball is.  To the geometrically inclined, you'll notice that it's a rhombic triacontahedron (try saying that 5 times fast!), a ball-like shape with edges formed by 30 rhombi (a rhombus is a four-sided equilateral with two pairs of parallel sides) that resemble scaled-down versions of an Egyptian pyramid done in red.  The ball feels somewhat alive, however.  It gives when you squeeze it and resumes it shape when you stop squeezing it.  As soon as you take out a piece, you'll discover that the ball is composed of 30 design blocks that use magnetism to adhere to one another.

As you take the pieces apart, the ball disappears and many regular and irregular shapes occur. Usually, that's the end for me.  I can never recover the original shape (my Rubik's cube is still a mess!), but the ball is easy to reform (if I can do it, you can too).

I like abstract shapes and I was pleased to find that the magnets act both to attract and repel the pieces. Unlike Lego pieces, connections can be made in all kinds of odd ways.  I also noticed that the pieces often reshape themselves, almost organically, as they choose a different connection than the one that I initiated. The casual results are often better than my planned ones.

Based on a suggestion in the workbook, I began mixing in other objects that could be held by the design blocks.  The results were infinitely more interesting and rewarding than anything I'd ever created before.  I felt a great sense of peace from the experience.  Many people had told me I would like sculpting, but I lacked the confidence to try.  With the Ball of Whacks, I felt like a super sculptor . . . but without any lessons.

After several days of working on abstract shapes, I decided to try geometric shapes.  These were paradoxically harder to do in many cases.  The magnetism sometimes fought me.  I had to design clever solutions to create the regularity I wanted to see.

I also left the Ball of Whacks out to see what others would say.  Everyone noticed that I kept changing it.  Without thinking, rewarding new designs would emerge in a few seconds.  I gained confidence in my creativity involving forms.

At the same time, I was working on a number of non-physical problems.  Soon, I began seeing metaphors in the blocks and my designs for those problems.  New and better solutions began to flood my mind.

Feeling like I should read more of the workbook, I now found myself intrigued by the directions for how to use the Ball of Whacks to expand my creative repertoire.  I began to see huge gaps between the methods I prefer to use, gaps that I could easily explore and understand with my new appreciation of my creativity habits.

Best of all, the lessons are deeply ingrained.  The human nervous system is mostly made up of connections between the hands and eyes to and from the brain.  By both holding and seeing what I was working on, the exercise connects more parts of my brain and experience.  I find totally different memories being stimulated, especially those from the sandbox and while playing with modular toys.

Today, I went back and totally redid a book proposal I'm working on.  I was astonished to see that my mind was connecting those little blocks from The Ball of Whacks into new ways of assembling the pieces of the proposal.  I would never have expected that.

What does the name mean?  I don't think there's just one meaning.  It obviously sounds like ""ball of wax"" which is something that warms and becomes malleable in our hands.  I'm reminded of the red wax that you peel off of Edam cheese to form shapes.  At another level, a ""whack"" in von Oech's vocabulary is a way of getting you to let go of artificial assumptions.  In that sense, this is a tool to give you lots of whacks.  And it does.

I haven't done all of the exercises yet, but I plan to.  Each of the ones I've done has been quite an eye-opener.

Here's a tip.  Turn off the TIVO while you're watching television and use the commercial breaks to play with the Ball.  The baseball playoffs are excellent for this purpose because you get all kinds of short delays.

Be smart.  Give a Ball of Whacks to each of your children rather than purchasing another toy.  You'll inspire genius that will constantly fascinate you.",An Epochal Innovation Breakthrough!

I wanted this because I was tired of being bored in the car so I was hoping that this would solve that problem. It turns out it actually did, for a little bit. Here's why:
PROS:
1) It does use a lot of imagination
2) I like the idea/concept
3) The individual pyramids are a good shape for making
4) I like the ball it makes when all pieces are together, I can even throw it in the air and catch it and it won't break
5) It is very addicting and fun at first, provides days of fun
CONS:
1) The magnets aren't strong, and you can't play with your creations without a piece falling off (I couldn't even shoot some hoops with it!)
2) The pieces get lost very easily if you aren't 101% careful
3) I got very bored of it after the first week of using this (maybe because I used it too much :)
4) There isn't a very wide variety of things to make
5) Can get very frustrating when making something because the magnets misbehave a lot (like ADHD)

After losing my irreplaceable Buckyballs, I was really trying to find a good alternative to occupy my time at work and this did come through to some extent, even if there are some preference issues. To start with the positive, it is a pretty big toy by comparison to my beloved Buckyballs (it's about the size of a baseball) and the pieces are hearty pieces of plastic with multiple magnets inside. They all fit and snap together easily and it is pretty easy to work with it. It is also interesting to figure out new combinations and disassemble, then put back into the ball configuration. As for the negative, the combination of the shape of the pieces and the locations of the magnets means: first, that the pieces have a clear point of connection and, second, deviating from this results in a connection that is less secure and falls apart easily or, if elevated, spins out of place. What all of this means, though, is that the range of structures is limited if said construct is going to be stable.

Lastly, regarding the book: there is a big philosophical emphasis on applying the methodology of constructing structures with the ""Ball of Whacks"" to everyday life situations. I cannot decide if this is negative or positive. For some, it may offer a different way of looking at situations, but I did not get much out of it that I did not already grasp. After reading a few pages, the book found its way to some lonely, relatively untouched section of counter space to sit until it is thrown away, I move, or recovered by some future archaeologist.

My grandson has always had an ability to see shapes and develop them into something original.
He has always liked Legos and moved on to more difficult shapes and products to satisfy his artistic and scientific self. For his birthday, he asked for this Ball of Whacks. Well, this has turned into one of his more interesting projects. I think he needs another two or three. He has created such diverse objects as dinosaurs, animals, turtles, sun, stars, fruits, and more artistic objects he has his own names for.

To say he likes this Ball of Whacks is a misnomer. He brings it with him, the car, park, friends, wherever. Everyone who sees him with it wants one of their own. He really should get a percentage from the owner.  He tells me he is fascinated with the shapes, to see what he can build. He has the kind of mind that can explore any possibility.

The Ball of Whacks Is made up of 30 magnetic design blocks that can be taken apart and rearranged. There does not seem to be any end to the shapes you can make. Accompanying the Ball Of Whacks is a 96 page booklet. This gives you Ideas of what kind of shapes you can make, and how to open your mind. For creative people this is a windfall, and for us, regular folks, it can open our minds from the most concrete manner of thinking to go and explore the possibilities.

The desk toy that everyone reaches for and plays with repeatedly over the past several years is the Zen magnets (like Buckyballs, but better).

The problem with the Ball of Whacks is that the magnets are not very strong and shapes other than the sphere based ones are unstable. Compare this to the Zen magnets where there are an uncountable number of shapes that can be made based on a dozen or two basic building block shapes.

The Ball of Whacks is a good size.  It fits right in the palm of an average sized hand.  I do think that the magnets holding the ball together could be slightly stronger as the ball has, on many occasions, spontaneously exploded into many pieces by giving it too hard of a squeeze.

This ball was supposed to increase my creative juices... has it?  Nope.  But that wasn't what I was looking for, so that selling point was moot anyway.  What I do find is that it's fun, and simple, and offers up a nice distraction for guests at my desk.

I've had plenty of hands on tactile 'toys' and this one should have delivered but it really falls short in comparison.

The object is to rearrange the pieces to an unlimited amount of variations including 'real' or abstract shapes. The problem is that the magnets are not really strong enough so they tend to slide around way to much to hold a shape. We have made a bunch of star shapes (we being my kids age 6 and 11) but even they are running out of ideas. The best thing is if you drop the ball, it shatters into 30 pieces.

Female,34,20.5,73,996,Basic,EN,Web,1459,"I recently got two of these balls for my cousins for Christmas. They're 8 and 11 years old and I was excited to see them tinkering with what seemed like a ""brain"" toy.

The ball is well constructed and provides a fair deal of entertainment as you mess around with how the pieces fit together. The packaging includes a nice booklet about the ball and certain shapes one can make. Unfortunately I found these 2D pictures to be next to useless. What's more is that every shape they showed was very similar to the fully assembled ball. And this brings me to the chief complaint.

There just isn't much you can do with these! I tried and tried again with my younger cousins, I'd sit down and say ""Alright, we're going to make something totally different from the ball"" but quite literally every time I tried, I'd come back to the same shape. This is because the pieces are naturally pretty odd and unfortunately don't fit together in lots of interesting ways. And like the other critical reviewer said: if you attempt to make something that doesn't ""lock together"" but is only held together by the magnetic attraction, it will be so slippery and flimsy that you can't do anything with it. The magnets are generally very weak, designed only to pull each piece together for the ball.

At this point, I would immediately recommend my favorite desk toy, a cube of neodymium magnet spheres. However, they're very dangerous for young children prone to swallowing them, and not really worth it for any younger kid that can't keep very good track of all 216 magnets (which is very necessary). So, I'll put the decision on you. If you're an adult, I promise you'll enjoy a magnet cube more. If you're buying for a young kid though, this is a good first foray into the world of magnetic tinkering toys. Just keep the cube in mind when they get a bit older.

Female,39,22.96,32,519,PhD,EN,Web,1497,"The first thing anyone who sees this for the first time is going to say is ""WHAT IS IT ?"" You'll quickly come to the conclusion that's a question much easier to ask than to answer. I guess the answer really is,""It's what ever you want it to be.""
  I went to my Synonym Finder and here are just a few of the names I came up with. They are all names we have used,most aren't even in the dictionary,and any one of them could be used to describe this ""thing"". Doohickie,dojigger,gizmo,whachamacallit,thingumajig,flumadiddle,widget,
thingumabob,are all pretty good names;but the inventor chooses to call it a ""Ball Of Whacks"";so I guess that's what it is.
 The pictures and descriptions describe it as well as anything But what to do with it is the question. It comes with a small book of 96 pages that describes how and why Roger von Oech invented it and what you can do with it. He describes the very interesting mathematics that is the basis of the shapes of the pieces or ""whacks"".To mathematicians,the Golden Ratio,the 30 sided rhombic triacontahedron ,and such have always fascinated scientists and are found many places in art and nature,and in this ball.
 The inventor also explains what great creative qualities can be found with the ball. The book shows the inventor with a young Buddist monk creating a sun sculpture.
This ball will fascinate anyone who picks it up,be they young,old, inquisitive or simply someone who likes to hold,handle and play with things. As soon as one realizes that reassembling it is not nearly as difficult as one might imagine;then the creative juices start to flow and they try to see what they can form. The book gives a lot of sculptures or forms to make;but in no time ,one wants to try their own ideas.
 My ball has all the same colored ""Whacks"",(red) ;but it comes in several colors and even in multi colors,where the various colors would add a whole other dimension to the creativeness of ""Ball Of Whacks"".This product is excellently made,will provide endless hours of enjoyment,relaxation and creativeness for anyone who picks it up.",What is it?

It's visually interesting, tactile, mildly amusing as you try to build something recognizable from the Platonic pieces.

Although you might learn something about solid geometry on an intuitive, hands-on level, my fascination with Ball of Whacks plateaued out after about 20 minutes of 3D recreation. It's pricey for the amount of time you might find yourself working with it; I might suggest ShapeScapeS for the neighborhood of $30, for someone who wants an interactive curiosity piece laying around when company comes over.

I was immediately drawn to it when I first saw it, and as soon as I got mine, I realized it was pretty ingenious and fun. I knew I was going to like it, what took me by surprise was my wife's reaction. She loved it so much, she constantly makes these awesome figures and puts them on our coffee table to leave there as decoration! Of course, I am reluctant to mess up her art, and you can't imagine the face she made when I told her I wanted to take the ball to my office (she's even planning on getting a metal tray and some other magnetic accessories to make into an interactive art station for our living room!).

The weird part is that after ignoring it for a while and then coming back to it weeks later, i begin to dream up all kinds of weird new inventions, ideas for shows, coffee flavors...Lots of these things are bogus or impractical (in this dimension perhaps XD), but occasionally i sit and ponder while just playing with the magnetic pieces and it helps me think clearly.

a) The kids make any pattern they choose; in other words, they all ignore the booklet that comes with it.  However, they drop pieces (accidentally) often; one piece was lost last year under an immovable object . . .  Having 29 instead of 30 pieces has made no difference in the popularity of the Ball of Whacks, however.

b) The dang thing is so popular that pieces of it have begun to disappear this year.  I honestly think, unfortunately, that people are stealing 2 or 3 pieces at a time, to fiddle with in their pocket or whatever.  I did not have that problem last year at all, but so far this year (and it isn't Thanksgiving yet!), my 29 pieces have shrunk down to just 20 pieces.  I've considered buying a new Ball of Whacks because the kids like it so incredibly much, but I hate to encourage stealing . . .  Now that Amazon has it on sale, however, I may break down and buy another.

Female,43,30.34,26,574,PhD,EN,Web,577,"Ball of Whacks, A Creativity Workshop in a Ball by Roger von Oech

I love toys and this one has me hooked.  Thirty-six plastic pyramids are fitted with magnets so they stick together with a satisfying ""clack"" to form a variety of geometric shapes.  The possibilities for creating stars, polygons, patterns, and random forms are limited only by imagination and accident.  I mention imagination because you can try to recreate the designs in the accompanying 96-page information booklet.  But accident, I found, was a much more satisfying process.  The pieces seem to ""jump"" into place forming surprise designs that, like a stream of consciousness, lead to further discoveries.  And this is one of the major intentions of this kinetic toy.

Roger von Oech is the author of A Whack on the Side of the Head, a book which describes the creative process and offers exercises to flex the inventive muscles.  He designed the Ball of Whacks to take advantage of the connections between the hand, the brain, and the creative process.  As our hands manipulate the whack pieces, our brain slips into a state of flow - critical for creativity.  So simply maneuvering the pieces becomes the most obvious way to make this toy an essential part of your creative work.
In addition, the information booklet gives more than a dozen suggestions for inducing the creative process for individuals, partners, and small groups.  Use it as you meditate.  Think of it as a metaphor for a problem.  Start a brainstorming session.  Or just take a mental stretch break!

Male,34,30.34,75,1515,graduate,EN,Web,618,"The Ball of Whacks can be a valuable tool for distraction and refocusing the mind during pain due to illness and disease.  My teenage son has suffered a condition that causes him intermittent pain, anxiety and distress.  I am continually looking for something to occupy his attention during such painful times.

I have noticed that in mild to moderate pain, playing with the Ball of Whacks beautifully distracts him.  His face relaxes, and he is engaged in creativity more than reactivity to pain, which seemingly allows his body to regroup as the pain often dissapates.

I suggest that the Ball of Whacks be more broadly considered a tool in 'pain management' for certain people and conditions.  I could also imagine its usefulness in a hospital or clinic setting, like for individuals waiting to undergo chemotherapy.  We are very grateful for this addition to wholistic care for our son!",Ball of Whacks very useful for pain management

In Quiddler, you create words, but unlike Scrabble, it's not always the one with the best vocabulary who gets the most points.  You try to make words out of all your letters - there might be a long word which gets lots of points, but it might be little brother over there who is able to make several short words who gets the ""most words"" bonus and jumps ahead of everyone else!
We played this game last night and were surprised how fast things change - someone who is way ahead after the 3rd round can be behind after the 4th.  Just one round can dramatically change things!

The first person to be able to play  their whole hand, with one card as a discard, goes out and the rest of the  players have one turn to put down as many words as possible.  Points are  scored based on letter value and some cards have more than one letter such  as ""qu"" or ""cl"".  You lose points for letters that  can't be played.  You cant play your cards on another players word.  Highest score after 8 hands is the winner.  Spelling and game usually don't  go well together but this is a fun game for any age.

It's essentially a cross between Scrabble and Rummy, but I would say there's more strategy in Quidder than in either of those games. The game is very easy to learn, but very difficult to master. After playing the game many times, I would offer the following tips: 1) As others have suggested, don't use a dictionary during ""main"" play. Just use one to resolve challenges, or to check spellings of words after a round has been completed. It makes the game much more challenging; 2) When playing with two players (which is the scenario where only one of the bonuses is used), use the bonus for longest word instead of the bonus for most words; 3) Don't allow slang words, as they make it too easy to use high point cards; 4) If some players take too long, feel free to employ some sort of time limit for turns. The game is much more enjoyable when it moves briskly.

All in all, the game is fantastic. I've given copies to about 4-5 friends as gifts. It's the most enjoyable word game I've ever played, and I was a Scrabble geek as a child!",Tremendous word game
